    "content": "*Ring, ring!*\n\t*Ring, ring!*\n\t*Ring, ring!*\n\t\n\tMarco fidgeted in bed as the loud alarm from his phone woke him up. He quickly came to his senses and stretched thoroughly as his alarm continued to blare in the background. He impulsively reached over to his phone and nearly knocked it off his nightstand trying to turn it off. He managed to succeed, briefly experiencing a moment of calm. As he rubbed his eyes, he got out of bed to prepare for the arrival of his school bus, signaling the beginning of another day at Pisay.\n\t\n\tHe walked over to the bathroom and hopped in the shower. The water from the shower briefly scalded him like it always does, which jolted him awake and eliminated all of his remaining grogginess. After finishing, he dried himself off with his favorite towel and went to the mirror to style his hair. “New quarter, new me,” he gleefully thought to himself. He got out and then changed into his summer uniform, ate his breakfast, put on his backpack, and went on his merry way out the front door as his mom waved him goodbye.  \n\t\n\tMarco smiled as he saw his school bus approaching his house from the distance. When it came to a halt, he immediately got on and sat next to his best friend, Brianna. \n\t\n\t“Hey Marco!” Brianna greeted. “Hey...!” Marco replied. They sat in silence for a few seconds as they tried to think of something to talk about. The only sound that filled the air was the light grazing of the bus’s wheels as it grazed across the roads leading to Pisay.\n\t“Sorry…wala akong maisip pag-usapan…” Brianna told Marco dejectedly.\n\t“Uh…are you excited for the 2nd Quarter? I wonder what our perio scores are,” said Marco.\n\t“Don’t talk to me about perio, man…bagsak ako sa Math nanaman…”\n\t“Don’t say that Bri…optimism is a virtue…!”\n\t“That’s easy for you to say…my grades are definitely gonna suck again. You’re probably gonna get straight unos like usual.”\n\t“Not entirely true. I also get 1.25s.” They both chuckled afterwards.\n\t\n\tThey spent the rest of their time on the bus catching up with what they did over the weekend, which they usually do every Monday. The other students in the bus, of which there were five, stayed silent as Marco and Brianna continued to chat. \n\t\n\tAfter about an hour, the bus finally entered the Pisay Main Campus and pulled up to the drop-off area just as all the students were making their way to the flag ceremony area. After they got off, they made their way to their designated lines, which were always right beside each other. On the way there, Marco noticed some light construction near the flagpole area that wasn’t there before. \n\t“What do you think they’re gonna announce today…?” Marco asked Brianna. \n\t“You already know…some club thing? New contest?”\n\t“I don’t care about that.”\n\t“You and me both, Marco. You and me both.”\n\t\n\tSoon, Marco spotted his first period teacher holding up a sign for 11-E and promptly fell in line, with Brianna making sure to line up next to him. As the student council members set up the flag ceremony, he thought about his performance during the previous quarter’s perio week. There had recently been an increase in difficulty, and in Marco’s mind, he aced all his exams. Nothing could keep him down.\n\t\n\tSoon, the flag ceremony started and everyone went through the motions, including Marco. He was finding it hard to pay attention to what was happening, instead focusing on the growing line of latecomers on the sidelines of the flag ceremony area. \n\t“Ha, suckers…” he thought to himself. After a few typical announcements and club promotions, it seemed like they would proceed to the PSHS hymn, but that was not the case.\n\t\n\tThe campus director of Pisay Main suddenly showed up, walking up to the microphone and calling for everyone’s attention. Marco was fairly confused by this and listened to whatever he had to say very intently. \n\t“Why is he here…?” he whispered to Brianna. \n\t“No clue,” she whispered back. \n\t“I have something very important to disclose for Grades 11 and 12,” the campus director said in a very disappointed tone. \n\t\n\t“Several stacks of your periodical exam answer sheets have gone missing.”\n\t\n\tImmediately after saying this, the students began loudly muttering to each other, trying to process what they’d just heard. Even more so were the Grade 11 and 12 students, who were in complete shock and having reactions ranging from pure disbelief to genuine anger. After hearing this, all Marco could do was stand still. He simply couldn’t believe that this happened. It can’t be true. Brianna covered her mouth with her hands, also in disbelief. Soon, the students’ voices became louder and louder until the campus director took to the microphone once more. \n\t\n\t“To clarify, we have searched far and wide for the missing stacks. We are currently carrying out a thorough investigation to track them all down,” he explained. \n\t“If we cannot find the sheets within the next few weeks, then the affected students may have to retake the periodical exams.” This explanation prompted even more worried and confused murmuring among the students, with some of them trying to come up to the campus director to ask questions about what happened. Several students became agitated and started loudly voicing their disappointment with what happened in the form of booing. \n\t\n\tMarco felt absolutely shattered. He felt all the noise around him being drowned out as the thought of what he’d just learned completely took over his mind. He started to breathe faster and began to lean on his knees with his hands. All that hard work he put in, all those tireless hours studying and preparing for every possible topic and type of question - all for nothing. \n\t“Marco…okay ka ba?” a concerned Brianna asked. \n\t“I’m fine…” he told her dismissively.\n\t\n\tEventually, the students got so unwieldy that the campus director decided to end the flag ceremony early and send everyone to their classes. \n\t“Bye, Marco…” Brianna called out to him as she followed the crowd through the Admin Building. Marco followed close behind, unable to show any particular emotion as a multitude of thoughts were running in his mind - none of which were pleasant. He stared at the ground as he walked up to SHB 405, thinking about how he may have to retake the perios that were lost, if he had any that were, and that he would most likely get a lower score. The perio was a week ago, he thought, and exams are measurements of how much information you can temporarily cram in your head and not how much you actually learned.\n\t\n\tSoon, he arrived at his first period class, Math, and sat down in his seat. All of his blockmates were still talking about what happened at the flag ceremony, wondering whether their perio papers were lost. Marco continued to sulk in his seat until his Math teacher, Ma’am Lareigh, arrived. Ma’am Lareigh started the Math period with a brief silence, knowing the gravity of the situation. \n\t“Bago natin simulan ang klase, gusto nyo bang pag-usapan yung in-announce sa flagcem...?” she asked the class. \n\t\n\tMarco’s hand immediately darted upwards, as he was desperate for answers. \n\t“Were my perios part of the missing stacks?” he asked when Ma’am called upon him, which prompted some death stares from his blockmates. Although slightly taken aback, Ma’am began to answer his question. \n\t“Yung perio answer sheets ng Block A, C, E, F, at G ang nawala natin. Lahat nun. Econ, Fil, Eng…at tsaka Math rin. Kaya oo, nawala yung sayo,” she replied in a slightly disappointed tone.\n\t\n\t“Thank you, Ma’am…” Marco meekly replied to her. \n\t“Nu ba ka naman…apektado rin kami…” his seatmate told him sternly. Marco slowly bowed his head down in shame as his blockmates started asking other questions. \n\t“Kung hindi namin mahanap yung mga papel ninyo, talagang kailangan niyong i-retake yun. Hindi sila magbibigay ng libreng perio, may mga blocks na hindi nawalan ng papel kasi…” Ma’am replied to another student asking a question. \n\t\n\tAfter the bell rang and Math class was dismissed, Marco lumbered over to the next room for SocSci double period. The time quickly breezed by after he accidentally fell asleep during the discussion, as he’d stayed up late the previous night thinking about his perio scores. Luckily for him, he was seated at the back, and Sir was only going over the basics of their alternative assessment, which he’d already thoroughly read about on KHub. Soon, the bell rang once more and woke him up. He put on his backpack and headed all the way down to the Kalachuchi Lane to get some fresh air.\n\t\n\n\n\n\t"

    "content": "As Marco made his way down the last flight of stairs of the SHB, he encountered Brianna heading up. \n\t“Hey Marco,” she said to him, but Marco was not in the mood to hold a conversation. He ignored her and walked past, confusing and worrying her slightly. He passed by the BLOB, which was bustling with students as it usually does at this time. He made his way up the ledge in front of the big grate and walked up to the tents of the Kalachuchi Lane, still sad about the situation with the perio papers. Soon, he sat down at one of the tables and stared off into the field.\n\t\n\t\tBefore he could let the feeling of sadness fully loom over him however, Darren, an old friend of his from his elementary days, suddenly appeared and began to approach his table.\n\t“Oh…hey, Darren…! Long time no see…er, talk, actually…“ Marco called out, clearly caught off-guard and not expecting his presence. He tried to make it appear as if he was doing something productive there, but he soon abandoned that notion. Darren quickly shuffled into the seat next to him, eager to talk to Marco again after so long. \n\t\n\t“Hey, Marco…! How’s…how’s it going?“ he asked nervously before quickly noticing that Marco was not in the best of moods. \n\t“...is something wrong…?” he asked Marco in a concerned tone.\n\t“I…I dunno. I've just been in a bad mood this whole day,“ he explained in a deeply sad and almost hopeless tone. \n\t“...dahil ba yan sa flagcem...?“ Darren replied. Marco softly nodded. He felt awful seeing Marco in such a sorry state. Darren felt the urge to give Marco a hug, but he quickly switched to a light couple of pats on the back.\n\t“It's going to be fine…“ he told Marco, \n\t\n\t“Huwag kang mag-alala.“ \n\t\n\tMarco felt warm inside by Darren’s reassurance, bringing a slight smile to his face.\n\t\n\tAfter a few seconds, Darren felt it was getting awkward and decided to get his hand off Marco’s back, using it to reach in his own bag.\n\t“Gusto mo bang mag-frisbee?“ he asked Marco as he pulled out a bright blue frisbee, knowing that he loves playing Ultimate Frisbee. Marco's face lit up slightly and he agreed to play, although not with the same enthusiasm as usual. They made their way to the middle of the field and got into position, with Darren holding the frisbee in the forehand throw position. \n\t“Ready?“ Darren called out to Marco, who was already in position to catch the frisbee. Marco nodded and Darren threw it with moderate force, which Marco easily caught. Darren thought about using this time to catch up with each other.\n\t\n\t“So…I've got a lot of stuff to do this quarter as usual…Res kasi…“ Darren explained as Marco threw the frisbee back, which Darren nearly missed as his throw was off. \n\t“I really wish I could hang out with you more. You're not usually this upset…is there anything else I can do?“ he asked further.\n\t“I don't think there's anything you can do…I just…bakit ito nangyari?!“ Marco exclaimed as he was running over to catch Darren's frisbee. \n\t“I'm trying to be on my best this year…last year my grades slipped, and I'm trying to rectify it…tapos ito ang nakukuha ko…!? Parang wala silang PAKE!“ he exclaimed as he gripped the frisbee tightly in his hands, visibly agitated. They both stayed silent for a while as they tossed the frisbee back and forth. After Marco calmed down, he impulsively muttered something under his breath.\n\t\n\t\n\t\t“...maybe someone’s behind this.”\n\t\t\n\t\t“What?” Darren asked as he was too far away to hear what Marco said.\n\t“...what if someone did this on purpose? I don’t think something like that can just…go missing. What if someone stole the papers...?” Marco proposed to Darren. He was slightly taken aback by this, and he thought about it for a few seconds before tossing the frisbee to Marco. \n\t“I don’t think that’s what happened, pero…posible ‘yun. Malay mo…” he replied. Soon, they fell silent once more, with Marco still in deep thought about the possibility.\n\t\n\tBecause of this, Marco started making some very poor throws, sending the frisbee rolling on the grass near Darren. \n\t“Ano yan, bro…” Darren said as he walked towards the frisbee. \n\t“Look, you throw it like this…see?” he explained as he made the motions of a forehand and backhand throw. \n\t“I know, I know…I’m just thinking…is all,” Marco explained as Darren threw the frisbee back at him. He caught it and geared up for a strong throw, energized by the thoughts coursing through his mind. He spun once, then twice, and then finally let go, sending it flying towards Darren.\n\t\n\tDarren yelped as he ducked under the frisbee right before it hit him. The frisbee continued to cut through the air, and to the horror of Marco and Darren, it was heading towards another student walking around the oval. \n\t“Heads! HEADS!!” Marco shouted, which caused the student to turn to his direction - but it was too late. The frisbee knocked her to the ground, sending both her and the stuff she was carrying to the asphalt path below. Marco and Darren quickly rushed to her aid and helped her gather her stuff.\n\t\n\t“Prairie, sorry ha…” Darren said apologetically as he picked up her papers. \n\t“Ay, ‘wag kang mag-alala. Alam ko na aksidente naman ‘yan,” Prairie assured him. \n\t“Wait, you know this person?” Marco asked in a slightly confused tone.\n\t“Batchmate natin ‘to, Marco, ‘di mo ba siya kilala?” he explained. \n\t“She’s the amateur detective of this batch. Alam mo nung na-kidnap si Claws?”\n\t“That one fluffy white cat…?” Marco asked, confused. \n\t“Oo. Nalaman niya kung sinong kumuha sa kanya,” Darren explained enthusiastically.\n\t\n\t“Uy, sinong tinatawag ‘mong amateur…” Prairie retorted. \n\t“Pero tama ka. Ako yung nakahanap kay Claws.”\n\t“Hey, you’re right!” Marco told Darren cheerfully as he flipped through one of her notebooks. \n\t“This is full of notes on…murder cases…?” he said before Darren lightly nudged him on the arm, causing him to give the notebook back to a slightly unamused Prairie. \n\t“Pupunta sana ako sa grandstand para makatrabaho ako sa isang kasong ini-imbestigahan ko…” Prairie explained. \n\t“May buong pamilyang pinatay sa Nevada at walang nakakaalam kung anong nangyari. Napaka-interesado, ‘di ba?”\n\t\n\tMarco and Darren just gave her a weird stare before finally picking all her stuff off the ground. “Okay, sure…I hope you solve whatever that is you’re working on,” Marco meekly replied to her. \n\t“Salamat…!” Prairie said gleefully. \n\t“By the way, have you found out anything about what happened to the perio papers? You know…that thing?” Marco asked her. \n\t“Ay, wala ‘kong alam diyan…pero sa tingin ko…baka may kasamaan sa likod niyan. Baka may nakuha ‘yung CCTV ng Pisay, pero kailangan suriin ‘yun,” she suggested.\n\t\n\t“Kailangan ko nang umalis…” Prairie explained as she started to head towards the grandstand. \n\t“Paalam...!” she called out as she left the two on their own. Marco and Darren stood there awkwardly for a few seconds as they waited for Prairie to get far enough away. \n\t“I think that’s enough frisbee for today,” Darren told Marco, breaking the silence. \n\t“Yeah, I agree. I kind of have to go too, I gotta do something for English…” Marco told him. “I’m definitely gonna look into what happened to the papers though. I have to try,” he said. Darren nodded, understanding where Marco was coming from. \n\t“I’m sorry I can’t meet with you more by the way…pero good luck…sa lahat,” Darren told Marco.\n\t\n\t“Bye, Darren!”\n\t“Ingat!”\n\n\t"

    "content": "The next day, Marco arrived much earlier to Pisay than usual as several of his busmates had gotten sick. He avoided his usual routine of going straight to his first period classroom and instead made his way to the library. As he laid in bed the previous night, he had come up with a plan to retrieve the footage from Pisay’s wide array of CCTV cameras. He had an acquaintance from long ago named Glenn that could help him with this exact situation. As he walked towards the entrance of the library, he started to rehearse what he would say to Glenn in his head. He opened the wooden doors and made his way to the archive room behind the computer lab. He looked inside and saw Glenn on his laptop, right where he expected him to be.\n\t\n\tMarco pressed his hand on the sliding glass door and slowly slid it open. Glenn continued to type on his laptop keyboard and paid no heed to Marco’s entrance. “Hey, Glenn…” Marco called out softly as he closed the door behind him. Glenn still paid no attention to him, causing Marco to drop the charade. \n“I know you heard me, Glenn. Come on, I’m right here,” Marco told him.\n“What do you want…” Glenn asked, clearly annoyed by Marco’s continued presence in the room. \n“I need your help…I’m currently investigating the disappearance of our perio papers. It’s…really important,” he explained.\n\n\t“Ah, yan…Block H ako, eh. Nandito pa rin ang mga papel ko. Kaya hindi ‘to tungkol sa aming mga papel,” Glenn snarkily retorted. \n“Kita mo ‘yung pinto diyan? Pwede ka bang…umalis?” he asked as he made the motion of a person walking with his fingers. Hearing this, Marco had enough. \n“Why are you being like this…?” he asked Glenn sternly. \n“Ok, Marco. Why do you think you can just walk up to me and pretend that everything’s fine all of a sudden? Do you need me to remind you what happened the last time I helped you with something?” he fired back. Marco was taken aback, not expecting Glenn to be this combative.\n\n\t“You’re STILL mad about what happened at the olympiad?! That was TWO years ago!” Marco exclaimed. \n“We were supposed to be a team, Marco! But you decided that helping me with the problems was too much for you!” he yelled at Marco. \n“Walang hiya ka! That was so embarrassing! We came in dead last. I never heard the end of it for a month! Tsaka nagkamali kami sa arithmetic pa…ARITHMETIC!”\n\n\t“You know what? Forget it! I don’t know why I asked you. You haven’t changed one bit. We are dealing with a matter of campus-wide importance and you would rather get hung up on a grudge than help right this terrible wrong!” Marco told him. \n“Don’t you have any empathy for the people who lost their papers? We worked hard on that - I worked hard on that!” Marco continued to explain in a slightly more subdued manner than before. Glenn let out a slight chuckle.\n\n\t“Nakakatawa, ‘no? You’re one to talk about empathy…” Glenn replied, proceeding to focus on his laptop once more. \n“The world doesn’t revolve around you, Marco. Now you’re using me not because I’m the Math guy, but because I’m the CS guy. Bahala ka nga…” Glenn said with a sense of finality. Marco continued to stand there despite sensing this. Eventually, he piped up again.\n\n\t“...how did you know I was going to ask you something CS-related…?” Marco asked earnestly. \n“Oh, I just figured. I had a feeling you were going to ask me to hack into security cameras, tap into a Wi-Fi network…stuff like that,” Glenn explained.  “I haven’t exactly figured out getting into servers yet though.”\n“So…can you do it…?” Marco asked. \n“Wow…talagang wala kang hiya, ‘no?” Glenn told him. \n“I can…but I won’t. Unless…” he continued, which left Marco waiting for a resolution. \n“...mag-sorry ka para sa ginawa mo.”\n\n\tMarco felt slightly annoyed by this, which Glenn knew was going to happen. “I thought I already did…” Marco brought up. \n“No, Marco, ‘I’m sorry you were dumb enough to help me’ does not count as an apology,” Glenn clarified. Marco prepared to say the dreaded phrase. \n“I’m sorry,” he said quietly. \n“…anong sinabi mo…?” Glenn asked condescendingly as he scooted closer to Marco while cupping his ear. \n“I hate you…” Marco muttered under his breath.\n\n\tMarco let out a forced cough and tried again. “I’m sorry for not helping you during the olympiad,” he said out loud. \n“There we go…now we can get to work,” Glenn calmly told Marco, who promptly sighed and sat next to him after hearing this. \n\n “So…anong gusto mong gawin?” Glenn asked.\n“Wait, can I just ask…where the heck did you get this laptop? Did you steal this from a military base or something…?” Marco asked as he examined Glenn’s laptop. It had extremely thick sides and seemed to be made of a steel alloy of some kind. It also had a small handle, allowing it to be carried like a briefcase.\n“My dad’s military, and it’s a hand-me-down…so yes,” Glenn confirmed to a shocked Marco.\n“Anyway, you got it right the first time. I need to look at the camera footage from every CCTV in Pisay after 3pm Thursday,” Marco told him. “I have a feeling someone stole the papers.”\n“Oh,” Glenn replied. “Well, getting in’s the easy part. Nagawa ko yun ng maraming beses noon. Mga 5 minutes tatagal.”\n\nMarco was slightly concerned by that casual admission but quickly focused back on the task at hand. “The hard part,” Glenn continued, “is sifting through all that footage. That’s hours of footage across tens of cameras. Nakakakain iyan ng oras.”\nDespite hearing this, Marco was determined to find anything that could lead him to the papers. “We’ve got around 50 minutes before the first bell…” he said as he glanced at his watch. \n”Let’s do this.”\n\t“You’re lucky this thing has a fast-forward button…” Glenn joked as he brought up some software he developed to mess with the cameras. It had quite a few visible glitches, with some buttons overlapping on each other and camera feeds appearing misaligned. “And before you say it, Webdev isn’t my strong suit. So shut it,” Glenn remarked.\n\t\n\t45 minutes later, they’d both become tired from looking through all the recordings. It felt like absolutely nothing of note was happening, and even more demotivating was the fact that they were still on footage from Thursday night. As Glenn continuously clicked and let go of the fast-forward button, Marco diligently looked through all the camera feeds at once to see anything suspicious. Glenn was quickly regretting agreeing to Marco’s request.\n\t\n\tJust when Glenn was about to fall asleep from sheer boredom, Marco suddenly leaned forward, causing him to jolt awake. “May nahanap ka…?” Glenn asked frantically. \n“I think I have…” Marco told him excitedly. He then pointed at a specific camera feed overlooking the entrance to the ASTB nearest to the FLOB. \n“Look at this…it turns pitch black for a few seconds and then suddenly returns back to normal. That has to mean something.”\n\n\tAt this point, Glenn was back to being annoyed with Marco. “That’s just a camera glitch. Walang kahulugan yan…” Glenn explained to Marco as he was fighting back the urge to fall back asleep. \n“Yeah, but for this long? It’s *really* unusual,” Marco said as he played the footage at normal speed. As the footage went from black to working, Marco noticed something that caught his eye. \n“What was that...?” he asked. \n“Does this thing have a button that moves by one frame?”\n\n“Oo, meron ‘yan…” Glenn told him half-heartedly, which prompted Marco to examine the anomaly frame-by-frame. He slowly pressed the button, waiting for the exact moment it switched. When he got to it, he was shocked by what he saw. He saw a glitched still of two boys walking towards the entrance carrying boxes with both of their hands. They were both wearing their school uniform and black ski masks, concealing their identities. But most of all, they were wearing bright red masks shaped like a bird outstretching its wings. \n“Are you seeing this…?!” Marco hurriedly asked Glenn, not able to believe what he was seeing. \n“My God…” Glenn replied as he looked intently at the frame. \n“Who are these people...?”\n\nAll of a sudden, the screen of Glenn’s laptop glitched out and then went completely dark. Marco quickly slid his finger across the touchpad, but it continued to be unresponsive. “Ay…nakalimutan ‘kong i-charge…” Glenn said in an irritated tone as he began to reach in his bag for his charger. Marco, however, was not buying it. \n“No…I saw your battery charge a few minutes ago, and it was nowhere near zero…”\n\n“...somebody’s watching us.”\n\n\tMarco stood up and frantically looked around, trying to see if anyone was watching them while Glenn continued to reach into his bag. He looked out the window connecting the archive room to the computer lab and saw someone standing near its entrance. The person briefly looked behind themselves before glancing at their tablet - and finally, made direct eye contact with Marco. Marco could see that they were wearing all black - face mask, coat, fingerless gloves and all. And most of all, they were wearing the aforementioned red bird mask, which he now noticed had orange dots lining the edges. Marco was struck with fear as the mystery person continued to stare back. \n\t\n\tA second later, the mystery person began to brisk walk towards the library entrance to leave, which made Marco quickly spring into action. He rushed to the door to get out, but it jammed slightly while he tried to open it. “Marco, what are you doing?!” Glenn asked, still not understanding what was happening. Marco finally managed to get the door open and ran towards the library entrance. He swung the door open and looked around, but there was no sign of them. No one was outside to be a witness, leaving Marco defeated.\n\t\n\tHe stomped on the ground out of frustration and quickly rushed back into the archive room. “Are you gonna explain…?” Glenn asked, annoyed. \n“Check the recent camera footage…NOW!” Marco ordered. \n“Someone was watching us just now…someone with a bird mask, just like theirs!” Glenn was bewildered by what he was being told, and now he wished he hadn’t tried to look for his charger. He turned his laptop back on and quickly brought up his camera-spying software. He looked through all the current camera feeds, only to find every single one of them offline. \n“They’re down…all of them…” he remarked. A few seconds later, however, they all came back online with no sign of the mystery person anywhere. \n\n\t“We lost him...!” Marco said before he yelled out a rude word that can’t be written here. \n“...all we can do now is show that picture of the guys with the bird masks to the admin. Go back to that point…” Marco told Glenn in a disappointed and defeated tone. Glenn went back to that point in the footage, only to find the black screen completely overwritten with a still frame of regular footage. It was at this point that Marco realized they were dealing with something else entirely.\n\n\tThe school bell suddenly rang loudly, signaling 5 minutes before the start of classes. Marco felt completely outsmarted and powerless at this point, but all he could do was set that aside and go to class. \n“Ok, now I’m really interested,” Glenn remarked as he turned off his laptop and put it back in his bag. \n“I think we just stumbled onto something big, Marco. Kung kailangan mo ako, alam mo kung nasaan ako.”\n\n\tGlenn put on his backpack and left Marco alone, who was still leaning on the table with his arms. Eventually, he gave up and left the library as well, not interested in getting reprimanded for being tardy. He entered his first period classroom just in time, the thought of what just happened still hot on his mind. He was far from done. Whatever was happening, he was going to get to the bottom of it.\n\t\n"

    "content": "At his classes, Marco couldn’t help but feel paranoid about everything around him. In his mind, anyone who looked at him for more than three seconds could be someone associated with the mystery person trying to spy on him. He was on high alert in both his English and his Filipino classes, but thankfully they were both just lectures, so his academic performance wasn’t affected. After the bell rang, he quickly made his way to the BLOB, with his eyes darting around to make sure no one was following him. \n\t\n\tHe glanced around and quickly found Brianna at her usual table. He brisk-walked towards her, but she was busy with something. As Marco walked up to Brianna, he noticed that she was listening to music on her earphones. Upon closer inspection, he realized that it was the latest single from BTS.\n“...you still listen to that trash...?“ he asked her. Brianna took off her earphones and gave Marco a dirty look.\n“Are you done insulting my music taste? It's not even that bad, maybe try listening to it first for once.“\n“You should listen to more underground artists, Bri...“ Marco replied. “Have you heard of Radiohead by any chance?“\n“Ewan ko nga sayo...“ Brianna told him as she began to put her headphones back on.\n“Wait…I have to talk to you about something important. We have to go to the gazebo. Now,” he ordered while motioning at her to get up. Brianna was left feeling confused by this sudden change in demeanor. \n“Um…what…?” she asked as Marco continued to look around. \n“I’ll explain later…just come with me.” Brianna reluctantly got up and they both made their way to the gazebos.\n\n\tOn the way there, Brianna continued looking for answers. “Marco, anong nangyayari…?” she asked him. \n“I’m starting to find out who stole the perio papers…this is much, much deeper than I could’ve imagined,” he explained while he began to lose his breath walking so fast. Soon, they made their way to the gazebo furthest from the SHB, which was shrouded in trees. They sat down and Marco continued to explain.\n“We have to go here because…we might be watched.”\n\n\t“Watched…? By who?”\n\t“I don’t know…at the library, we looked at the CCTV footage and saw these two masked men carrying papers in the middle of the night…!”\n\t“Wait, who’s we…?”\n\t“Oh, I approached Glenn at the archive room this morning. He helped me get into the system…anyway, before we could take a screenshot of what we saw, I noticed this…man…wearing a red mask watching us. I tried to catch him, but he slipped away…”\n\tBrianna felt shocked but also a bit skeptical of what she was hearing.\n\t“...and he somehow managed to wipe or modify any incriminating footage we could’ve used. I can’t report this to Pisay since I have *no* proof, and now I’m pretty sure this guy’s hunting me down. I…I don’t know what to do,” Marco said dejectedly as he sunk his hands into his face and faced the floor.\n\t\n\tBrianna sensed that Marco was under a lot of stress. “Hey…look at me, Marco,” she told him. \n“It’s okay. You can figure this out…I know you can. Alam mo ba kung sinong tumingin sayo…?” she asked. \n“No…his entire face was obscured, and you know how bad I am at remembering people’s faces…” he replied. \n“Glenn was in his bag looking for his charger, so he didn’t see him…I’m never going to find him.”\n\n\t“Hey…”, Brianna said to Marco, “you can still think of something…!”\n\t“But how…?! I have nothing to go off of…I literally have *no idea* who he, or any of the guys I saw on the cameras are…!” Marco explained angrily. \n“If he’s met those people, I haven’t a clue where they would possibly meet…and he’s probably wiped the footage anyway.”\n\n\tMarco took a deep breath in and out and attempted to calm down. As he did so, Brianna thought about what he just said. “If they have met somewhere, they probably would’ve done it in secret…parang ganito,” she told him. She paused for a while, contemplating what she was about to say. \n“I don’t know if this will be useful to you…but I noticed something last quarter.” Marco perked up, eager to hear what she had to say. \n\n“Alam mo na may SCALE ako sa 4th Floor Audi, diba? Well, I noticed that that door across 409 is always opened, just slightly. Electrical room ba ‘yun? Di ‘ko alam. Pero, I have walked past it a few times on other days, and it’s always closed. Just on Wednesdays is it open,” she told Marco. \n“It could be anything else, but…maybe that’s where they meet.”\n\nMarco was slightly cheered up by this. “I could look into that. There’s a big chance it’s not, but at this point, I have to try everything. I have to bring them to justice. Is there any other place you’ve noticed weird things about…?” he asked her, to which she shook her head. \n“Alright…I’m going to try to catch them in the act tomorrow. Then this can all be over…” he told Brianna.\n\n“Wait…you can’t just go up to them. Baka bugbugin ka nila…! Sikreto ‘yun eh. Ingat ka…” she warned him.\n“You’re right…that’s too dangerous…” Marco said as he pondered his options. \n“Maybe I can infiltrate them…” he suggested. \n“...I know what outfits they wear. Black balaclavas with that red bird mask. And I got a better look at it when I saw that guy at the library. It had this bird beak at the top…two wing shapes on both sides…and orange beads all around.”\n\nBrianna continued to listen intently as Marco outlined his plan. “I can print the mask I saw at the Infinity Lab since I’m in Tech. I’ll try to recreate that mask as best as I can and get a balaclava, and when next, *next* Wednesday comes around…I’m going to impersonate one of the guys I saw on the cams. He has a very similar build to mine.” Brianna was taken aback by how ambitious Marco’s plan was. \n“I know I’m operating on so many assumptions here, like…they might not even show up there…they may not be in the same outfit…but I have to try. What do you think, Bri…?”\n\n“I think that could work. Pero mag-ingat ka…huwag kang gumawa ng hindi mo muna inisip,” she told him. Marco seemed to be brought at ease now that he had a clear plan before him. \n“Don’t worry, Bri…I’ll do my best. I promise,” he reassured her. He got up from the gazebo sitting area and prepared to leave, but not before saying one last thing. \n“By the way, pretend this never happened. Don’t talk about this to anyone. Not even your friends”, he warned her. \n“Wala naman akong kaibigan na hindi ikaw, Marco. Huwag kang mag-alala,” she replied.\n\nMarco walked away from the gazebo, leaving Brianna to process the conversation she just had. From that point, he was dead-set on his plan, and over the next week he worked tirelessly on it. Every night at home, he worked on modeling a replica of the bird mask on AutoCAD for hours at a time. He made sure to add every fine detail he could make out from his encounter at the library, from its size to its curvature in all axes. While he was working on this, he also ordered a black balaclava, orange beads, and red paint online, which arrived at his doorstep shortly after. He continued to look out every school day for anyone who could be the mystery man to no avail.\n\nTwo days before Wednesday, he went to the Infinity Lab with Brianna to 3D print the finished replica. He made sure to pick the 3D printer that was least visible from the CCTV camera in the room and started the process. It took the entire school day, but when he went back at dismissal, he saw Brianna waiting by the replica. He picked it up and was thankful to find that it had printed with no defects. Right before Wednesday, he painted the replica bright red and carefully stuck the orange beads around the edge just like he had seen. He glued it to the balaclava, creating his final disguise. \n\n“What do you think of this? Is this convincing enough?” Marco messaged Brianna on Discord, attached with a picture of him in his bedroom wearing the mask. \n“looks good” she replied, along with a thumbs-up emoji right after.\n“good luck tomorrow, be careful” she messaged one final time.\n\nWednesday finally rolled around, and Marco was more than prepared for it. He arrived as early as he could in the morning and quickly made his way to the electrical room. When he got there, he tried to open the door, but it was locked. “They’re not here yet…” he thought. He decided to hide in SHB room 409 next to the door and wait for the culprits to arrive, if they ever did. He waited for hours, killing time by playing games on his phone on silent. Around two hours later, Marco heard a set of keys rattling across the hallway. He held his breath as he heard a door open along with a voice that was clearly a student’s say: \n\n“We’re in. Go.”\n\nThis was it. There was no turning back. He heard multiple sets of footsteps, which told Marco that around 2 to 3 people entered. A few seconds later, Marco heard them close the door, but he could tell by the sound that they didn’t close it all the way. He didn’t hear any footsteps outside, so he deduced that no one was outside guarding the door. He could’ve gotten up and walked to the door at that moment, but anxiety made him unable to move. He thought very carefully about his next course of action just like Brianna said, and as he was doing so, he heard another set of footsteps coming from the hallway. Marco got startled and made a slight sound, which caught the attention of whoever it was.\n\n Marco realized what he’d done when the footsteps suddenly stopped. He held his breath as hard as he could and sat completely still, hand on his mouth as time seemed to stand still. The footsteps continued to get closer. And closer. Marco was exerting so much effort to be silent. He was on the brink of shedding a tear. But suddenly, he heard the door open and a voice call out “Come in.” The footsteps then went in the direction of the door, which closed shortly after.\n \nMarco gasped for air as a tear rolled down his cheek. He looked up as he caught his breath, thankful that he wasn’t caught. He knew he couldn’t stay there any longer. He gathered himself, wore the mask, and placed his hands on the ground. He pushed himself up and stood on his feet, ready to face whoever would be on the other end of the door. He made his way to the entrance of the hallway as quietly as he could and walked normally to the door to trick whoever was guarding it. He took a deep breath before opening it slowly.\n\n"

    "content": "When Marco opened the door, chills ran down his spine as he saw who was guarding it. It was the mystery person he saw at the archive room, still wearing the same outfit he donned during their brief encounter. “Heatwave?” the man asked him. Marco was at a loss as to how to respond. Was this a password he had to complete? What is Heatwave referring to? Was this his codename? As precious seconds passed by, Marco knew he had to respond soon. When Marco opened the door, chills ran down his spine as he saw who was guarding it. It was the mystery person he saw at the archive room, still wearing the same outfit he donned during their brief encounter. “Heatwave?” the man asked him. Marco was at a loss as to how to respond. Was this a password he had to complete? What is Heatwave referring to? Was this his codename? As precious seconds passed by, Marco knew he had to respond soon. \n“Yes…?” Marco managed to say through his nervousness.\n\nThe mystery person paused for a bit and looked inside the room. He turned towards Marco and nodded his head lightly, allowing Marco to enter - much to his relief. Marco slowly walked inside the room, which was completely dark and cramped, only being lit by a single red light coming from a fuse box in the middle of the back wall, which had a set of keys placed on it. \n\nThe room was filled with fuse boxes and generators, with pipes and wiring lining the walls, looking almost serpentine in appearance. The other members were also wearing the same thing he did - their Pisay uniform along with their balaclavas and bird masks - which thankfully allowed him to blend in perfectly. The mystery person slowly closed the door when Marco made it to the middle of the room.\n\nHe walked to the back of the room, for what felt like an eternity to Marco, and cleared his throat. Staring at the fuse box with the red light, he began to do a roll call. “...Voltage…?” he asked, to which the only girl in the group raised her hand and replied “Present.” At that point, Marco realized that they all had codenames, and that of the member he was impersonating was Heatwave. \n“Fahrenheit…?” a guy raised his hand. “Present.”\n“Celsius?” another guy raised his hand. “Present, as always.”\n\t“Wildfire?” a big, bulky guy raised his hand and declared himself present.\n\tSoon, the mystery person called out another codename. \n“Heatwave?” Marco immediately knew that was his cue. \n“Present…” he said meekly. \n“And of course, there’s me…Obsidian” the mystery person said, which Marco took note of. Obsidian walked to the middle of the group and took a long pause before beginning his spiel. \n“I wish we could all be here…the rest of us are either busy with other commitments or just sick, just so you know. Rest assured, everything will still go as it should,” he explained calmly. “Everything last week went exactly according to plan. I’ve disposed of the ashes of those papers somewhere they’ll never find.”\n\n\tMarco could not believe the admission he’d just heard. He then remembered thinking about recording everything, but it was too late to do that now without it being suspicious. “This may be a huge victory for us, but I must remind you all that this is the first step of a much bigger initiative. An initiative that won’t work if *any* of you let your guard down,” Obsidian explained further as he paced around the group. \n“Tell that to Octane…” Marco overheard Fahrenheit whisper jeeringly to Celsius while nudging him on the shoulder, which Obsidian noticed but quickly ignored.\n\n“But - and you all know about this - we still have a big problem on our hands,” Obsidian clarified. \n“That flash drive is still out there. We are running out of time. If we don’t get it back soon, our spark could go out before we…light it,” Obsidian said sternly. \n“Any updates on tracking down the drive…or Radium…?” he asked calmly as he stopped pacing, looking sternly over the group. \n“Naghahanap pa kami,” Voltage explained. \n“Pasensya na.”\n\nHearing this, Obsidian stared emotionless at Voltage. He walked up to her slowly, stopping just inches away from her. “It’s been 5 months. Why haven’t we found them yet…?” he asked Voltage through gritted teeth. \n“Madulas siya…alam mo iyan,” she replied in a defensive tone. \n“Kaya naman napakagaling siya noon…” Obsidian stared at her for a few seconds and proceeded to walk away.\n\n\t“You keep failing this cause…all of you. Let me remind you all what we’re fighting for. We’re trying to destroy an institution that has failed us…a system that has turned us into shells of ourselves. No one said it would be easy. We’re doing this simply because it’s the right thing to do. To prevent the suffering of so many more who may come after us. And that will only happen if Pisay crumbles.”\n\t\n\tAs the members started to bow their heads in shame, Marco was shocked by the extreme manifesto Obsidian just expressed. He knew that he was surrounded by lunatics and that he was in grave, grave danger. Whatever he did next would have to be very cautiously thought out. “And when this institution crumbles…” Obsidian added, “...a new one will take its place, bigger and better than this one. Like a phoenix rising from the ashes.” Obsidian eyed Marco as he said this, which made him tense up.\n\t\n\t“*That* is why we are called the Rising Phoenix. Do you understand…?” Obsidian asked, to which all the members nodded lightly to. \n“Good. I hope you understand now why we have to find that drive. It is of utmost importance…” he continued.\n\n\t“Isn’t that right, Marco…?” Obsidian said as he looked straight at him.\n\t\n\tMarco was caught incredibly off-guard. His cover was blown. He was exposed to the wolves surrounding him. The other members looked at each other, confused. They were sure that Heatwave wasn’t named Marco. They murmured to each other and began to rapidly approach him. This was it. This was how he was going to die. Before they could lay a finger on him though, Obsidian told them to stop. Immediately, they all stopped in their tracks. He motioned to them to form a circle around a terrified Marco. \n\t\n\t“I’ve been waiting for you to show up…” Obsidian said as he walked up to Marco. He was still trembling from what was happening at the moment. Unable to hold form much longer, his left knee fell to the ground, which made him use his left fist for support. \n“I don’t want to hurt you…I just want you to understand,” he said as he walked in front of Marco and looked down at him. \n“You’re a guy with lots of potential…and I think at the moment, it’s not being put to good use. We could use someone with your influence in the Rising Phoenix.” \n\n\t“How…did you know…?” Marco asked, trembling and still looking down at the floor. \n“Oh…we know everything,” Obsidian replied. “We have our ways.”\n\n\t“I know that you always feel inadequate…like no matter what you do, you’ll never be good enough. That’s not a pleasant feeling, is it…?” he asked Marco. All he could do was nod his head in agreement, since he knew that what Obsidian was saying was true. \n“Who do you think is pushing that feeling onto you…?” Obsidian asked, to which Marco stayed silent. \n“It’s Pisay, Marco. They’ve been the problem all this time, and we’re the only ones who have the capability to admit it.”\n\n\t“You could be part of something bigger than yourself. Something that will finally give you the importance you deserve. A chance to make this country just a little bit…better,” he told Marco. \n“But if Pisay collapses…” Marco asked meekly, “...where will I go…?” \n\n\t“There are other high schools. You’ll be at peace knowing something greater will arise from its destruction,” Obsidian replied. He walked to the back of the room to the red-lit fuse box and grabbed the keys he placed on it. \n“We burned those papers for a greater purpose…as a part of our ultimate plan.” He used the keys to unlock the fuse box and took a set of papers out of the box before locking it once more.\n\n\t“We are firm believers in second chances. And for the record, I’m sorry you got caught in the crossfire. You shouldn’t have to be collateral damage. That’s why we saved this.” Obsidian then held up the papers in front of Marco’s face. As he looked at them, he couldn’t believe what was written on them. \n“MADLANGBAYAN, Marco Janus L.” it said on the top. They were his perio answer sheets, all perfectly preserved and not burnt to ash like he’d thought a few minutes ago. Obsidian motioned to Wildfire to open the door while he briefly looked behind him and pressed the earpiece he was wearing, telling someone on the other side to “Get in position”. \n\n\tThe white light from the hallway cut into the room and created a harsh shadow in front of Marco, who was still kneeling. “If you join us,” Obsidian posited, “...you can get your answer sheets back. You can say that you found them at the back of the ASTB. You won’t have to do the retake tomorrow. Everything will be right again.” Marco didn’t know what to say. He had a difficult decision before him. Would he join the very people he’d been hunting for a week?\n\t\n\tHe continued to kneel on the floor as the members surrounding him eagerly awaited his response. Obsidian stood still, waiting as well. Marco could feel his right hand gravitating towards the papers, desperately wanting to take the easy way out of his predicament. He grasped the papers with his pointer and thumb before coming to his senses. “...what about Darren…?”\n\t\n\tObsidian’s moment of satisfaction was swiftly cut short. “What about him?” Obsidian asked him. “What we’re doing here is more important than some classmate. You’ll see.” Marco paused for a moment, anger building up inside him. \n“He’s more than that to me,” Marco said as he looked up at Obsidian. \n“And so is Brianna, and everyone else I care about. They lost their papers too. They also matter!” he told Obsidian as he slowly got up from the floor. \n“That’s one aspect I regret about this whole thing. But this is how it must be. They wouldn’t understand us, Marco. Nobody truly does,” Obsidian told him sternly, attempting to swing him back to their side.\n\n\t“No. I know why you chose me. You chose me because you thought you could exploit my insecurities and goad me into joining your radical cause. Well I’m telling you now, MALI KA! Hindi ako sasali dito!” he said right to Obsidian’s face. Obsidian remained silent, both surprised and angry at what he’d been told, but showing none of it on his face. \n“Ok. I see how it is,” he told Marco. All the members remained still, awaiting Obsidian’s instructions. Suddenly. Obsidian shouted “Close the door!” to Wildfire, who was still holding it open. When Marco heard that, he knew he had to get out *immediately*.\n\n\tHe jumped as hard as he could towards the exit right as Wildfire was closing the door, narrowly passing through the gap right before it disappeared. Marco then quickly got up and ran away from the electrical room as fast as he could. “Get him,” Obsidian said calmly to all the members in the room, which prompted them to spring into action and chase after Marco. After giving the order, Obsidian pressed his earpiece once more and spoke. \n\t\n“He bailed.”\n\t“You know what to do.”\n\t\n"

    "content": "Marco dashed towards the 4th floor exit as fast as he could. As he ran, he saw another Rising Phoenix member walking out of the ADTech lab out of the corner of his eye. He got to the stairs. His feet almost glided across the steps as he ran down them as fast as he could, jumping at the last few steps just to save that little bit of time. He ran down the second set of stairs, but before he could head to the 2nd floor, another member blocked his way. It was the real Heatwave, and he was also chasing after him. He was being surrounded on all fronts.\n\t\n\tChange of plans - run to the other side of the building and take the BLOB stairs to escape, he thought quickly. He entered the 3rd floor and ran as fast as his legs could take. But before he could choose which hallway to take, two members flanked both sides. The only place he could run to was the open door in front, which led straight to the 3rd floor auditorium. As both members walked towards him, he barged through the door and slammed it shut. The backstage was pitch black dark as it usually is. Marco ran to the right side, arriving at the opening leading to the main stage, which was far from empty.\n\t\n\tThere was a Grade 9 section practicing for Paskorus. “Why are they doing final rehearsals so early…?” Marco thought to himself. However, that thought was quickly cut short when he heard the back door swing open. Not knowing where to go, he looked everywhere for an exit. He noticed a set of ladders leading to the top of the stage and ran to it. As he climbed up, he saw one of the Rising Phoenix members come around the corner, spotting Marco. It was Wildfire, the one who held the door open just a minute ago.\n\t\n\tMarco climbed up and finally made it to the top. The ceiling only consisted of a mesh of metal wire, with bars of metal supports running through at wide intervals. The walls were covered with the writings of previous batches who hung up props there before. The orange hue coming from below shone through the mesh, creating the only source of light there. As Marco stepped on the mesh, he looked down and realized how far up he was off the ground, which caused him to briefly lose balance. Every step he made was careful and deliberate as he tried to get to the other side to make his escape. But that was not meant to be.\n\t\n\tWhen Marco made it to the middle of the mesh, he froze after hearing metal clattering on the other side. Heatwave was climbing up the ladder, right before his eyes. Marco stopped dead in his tracks as Heatwave gained his footing on the mesh. He then heard more clattering from behind him. It was Wildfire. They were now blocking any paths Marco could take to safety. There was no running now. The only way out was to fight.\n\t\n\tFrom down below, Marco could hear the Grade 9s beginning their performance, which involved lots of loud instruments and music. As soon as it started to pick up, Wildfire and Heatwave began to approach him. Marco quickly attempted to sidestep Heatwave, but he was immediately grabbed by the collar and thrown face-down to the ground. Bang! The loud sound was drowned out by the blaring of speakers and the shrill tings of xylophones from the Paskorus performance, which Marco caught a brief glimpse of while he lay in pain on the ground. Wildfire grunted as he picked Marco up with both hands by the back of his uniform and, with all his strength, tossed him towards the back wall. Marco’s limbs splayed outward as he impacted it, with gravity sending him crashing down.\n\t\n\tWildfire quickly dashed towards Marco, who was still trying to get back up, and tried to kick him in the face. Marco managed to block it with his arms at the last second, but the impact still left his arms sore. Marco quickly got back up on his feet and desperately tried to tackle Heatwave, but Heatwave anchored himself to the mesh with his shoes, rendering it ineffective. Seeing this, Wildfire went up and kicked Marco in the stomach, which knocked the air out of him. Heatwave added further by elbowing Marco’s back, which hurt immensely. Wildfire once again grabbed Marco and threw him, with the ongoing Paskorus performance still being loud enough to mask all the noise they were making.\n\t\n\tMarco coughed and wheezed from the searing pain, barely able to move his joints. Wildfire held Marco up by the armpits and faced him towards Heatwave, who was preparing himself for some hefty blows. He stepped forward and delivered a nasty left hook to Marco’s face, quickly followed by a right to his liver. Reeling from the pain but still somewhat aware, Marco stomped his feet off the mesh and managed to kick Heatwave in the face. This also sent Wildfire falling backwards, causing him to crash at the front wall. \n\t\nWildfire briefly let go of Marco, who used the opportunity to crawl towards one of the ladders. He was too slow however, as Heatwave got up, ran to him, and kicked him down. At that point, Marco couldn't bear the pain anymore and lay motionless on the ground. Heatwave dragged Marco across the mesh by the legs as the Paskorus performance continued to blare in the background. He handed Marco over to Wildfire, who picked him up and carried him on his shoulder. Marco was somehow still conscious and aware that something terrible was about to befall him. Standing at the middle of the mesh, Wildfire bent backwards and slammed Marco to the ground with all his remaining strength.\n\n\tThe mesh snapped at the area where Marco impacted it, with only a small sliver keeping together and preventing it from falling off. Wildfire and Heatwave adjusted their clothes and walked off to the ladders, with both of them taking a different one down. Marco lay still on the mesh, which was quickly starting to break. The performance below wrapped up at that very moment, and someone from the audience noticed Marco, and the bit of mesh, peeking out from the ceiling. Soon, the students below also noticed and got out of the way. The metal of the remaining bits crackled as Marco sank further down - he felt this and quietly accepted his fate.\n\t\n  The mesh snapped, sending Marco falling down towards the hard-floored stage. He slammed hard onto the ground, instantly knocking him unconscious. Everyone in the auditorium was shocked and soon swarmed him to check on his condition. He was swiftly carried out of the auditorium to the nearest medical services.\n\n  "

    "content": "“Unh…” Marco uttered as he woke up. He blinked a few times before opening his eyes. He found himself lying in a hospital bed surrounded by blue curtains. After taking in his surroundings for a while, he finally recognized where he was. He was in Philippine Children’s Medical Center. \n\n“Hello…?” he called out, to which a nurse pulled back the curtain a few seconds later. \n“Okay ka na ba? Wala namang sumasakit…?” she asked, with Marco reassuring her that he was fine. He wasn’t experiencing any pain aside from the light headache you get sometimes after waking up from a nap. He was still a bit weak, however, from the beating he took earlier.\n\n\t“What time is it…?” Marco asked the nurse as he rubbed his eyes. \n“5:23 po,” she replied, reading the time from her watch as she performed one last checkup. \n“Salamat na lang at wala kang masyadong na-injure…meron ka lang mga pasa dito, siguro dahil sa pagkahulog mo. Ayan o…” she said as she pointed at a fairly big bruise on Marco’s back. \n“Magpahinga ka muna tapos pwede ka nang lumabas,” she told Marco, to which he nodded. \n“Tsaka…may naghihintay sa iyo sa labas.”\n\n\tMarco’s curiosity piqued when he heard this. As the nurse left, he wondered who could be waiting for him. “It must be Darren or Brianna,” he thought. He laid in the hospital bed for half an hour, after which he felt strong enough to get up and leave. Just before he was about to leave, a doctor came in and checked up on him, coming to the same conclusion the nurse did. The doctor also allowed Marco to return to school tomorrow, much to his surprise. He sat up and put on his shoes before opening the curtain. \n“Ay, magaling ka na? Sige…ingat!” the nurse told Marco as he left the room. As soon as he got outside, however, he was greeted with a concerning sight. The head of the Discipline Office, Sir Ernest, was sitting outside with a tablet in his hand. He was in the audience of the 3rd floor Audi when he fell through, which warranted his presence there.\n\n\t“Hello Mark. Umupo ka dito,” he told Marco, who cautiously walked up to him. \n“Marco po ako, Sir…” he corrected, which elicited no response from Sir Ernest. Marco made sure to sit down on the seat beside Sir as properly as he could. \n“Marco, nandito ako kasi…gusto ko lang malaman kung anong iniisip mo,” he explained in a calm but intimidating manner. \n“Bakit mo inakyat yung 3rd floor Audi ng walang permission, at habang may nag-peperform pa?” he asked. Marco tensed up. He had no idea how he was going to explain it all to Sir.\n\n\t“Sir…mayroon kasing…sorry. I was being chased there. These students, they beat me up…that’s why I have these bruises. Check the cameras, please, you’ll see them…!” he desperately tried to explain. Sir stared at him sternly for a few seconds. \n“...bakit ka nagsisinungaling sa akin, Marco?” Sir asked. \n“Alam mong hindi nangyari iyan. Chineck namin yung CCTV. Tingnan mo…” Sir Ernest turned on the tablet and opened the gallery app. He opened the first video on it, showing the footage the cameras captured from a few hours ago. It showed Marco running to the back entrance of the 3rd floor auditorium, all by himself with no one else in sight.\n\n\t“No…”, Marco said under his breath, realizing that the Rising Phoenix had struck again. He considered telling Sir Ernest that the footage had been manipulated by them, but he quickly realized that he would just look crazy and dig himself a deeper hole. \n“Anong ginagawa mo sa electrical room? Diba hindi pinapayagan ang mga estudyante diyan? Delikado yan…makukuryente ka!” Sir explained sternly. \n\nMarco said nothing, choosing to stare blankly at the floor and contemplate his life. “Alam ko na…na-s-stress ka, no?” Sir theorized, which confused Marco. \n“Importante yung mental health…kapag kailangan mo ng tulong, sabihin mo, ha? Eto…” Sir reached into his pocket, pulled out a brochure, and gave it to Marco. \n“Three Cheers for Mental Health! Tips and Tricks on Caring for the Mind” it said on the front. All Marco could do was stare at it with a feeling of disdain and secondhand embarrassment. \n\n\t“Yun ba…?” Sir asked, waiting for Marco’s confirmation. \n“Yeah…that’s why,” Marco said reluctantly in order to play along. \n“Maganda yan pakinggan…kasi, alam mo na yung ginawa mo ay pwedeng Level 3 offense, diba…?” Marco’s eyes widened when he heard this. He forgot that he technically damaged school property when he fell through the roof. \n“Pero, dahil may awa kami, kailangan mo lang mag-community service ng 10 hours,” Sir explained further. \n“Alangan namang pigilan ka namin dahil lang sa nangyari dito. Yung pag-aayos ng audi, isang libo lang naman iyon.”\n\n\t“...thank you,” Marco said, surprised that Sir was even doing this. \n“Also, before you go…were Darren and Brianna waiting here…?” Marco asked Sir. \n“Darren ba siya? May nakita akong lalaking gustong sumama dito…pero, hindi ko siya pinayagan,” he replied. Sir then stood up and started to leave. \n“Good luck sa perio retake mo…sana mataas ulit ang score mo. Nandyan na yung mama mo,” he said as he pointed twice to the direction of the entrance of the hospital, leaving Marco shortly after.\n\n\tMarco sat down for a while before heading to the entrance. He sighed as he adjusted his uniform and removed his pins from his ID lace before getting in his mom’s car, where they began to drive home. Marco’s mom said nothing as he got in the backseat, and he could feel the tension in the air as they left the premises.\n“Son...this is not how I expect you to act,” Marco’s mom chimed in. “What has gotten into you…?” A deafening silence filled the car as Marco racked his brain thinking of an appropriate response.\n“Sorry, Mama. I just…I won’t do it again,” Marco replied sheepishly. More agonizing seconds passed as they continued to drive, which made Marco even more uncomfortable. \n“I sure hope you don’t,” Marco’s mom replied sternly as she looked at him through the rearview mirror. They made their way back home as Marco sat silently in the back, feeling absolutely terrible about everything.\n\nThe very next day, Marco came into Pisay already in a terrible mood. Today, he would have to retake the Math and Physics perios, both of which he didn’t have as much confidence in acing as before. When he went into Block E’s assigned testing room, he was surprised to find a Chromebook on every table in the room.\n\n\tSeveral of his blockmates were already seated, with the proctor, Ma'am Lareigh, sitting at her desk at the front of the room. “Good morning po, Ma’am…” he greeted her. \n“...what’s with all these Chromebooks?” he asked. \n“Ah, dito niyo sasagutan yung perio. Lumilipat sila sa digital dahil sa nangyari sa mga papel,” she explained. \n“Papaliwanagin natin naman yan bago tayong magsimula.” Marco understood the reasoning, but was still perplexed that they had so many tablets available. Nonetheless, he sat in a chair right in the middle and waited for the perios to start. After a few minutes, Ma’am told everyone to place their bags at the front and explained how to input their answers on the tablets, adding that scratch work can be done on any paper. With that, the perios finally started.\n\n\tAs he answered the Math perio, a feeling of dread slowly began to set in. He was able to answer some of the questions, but he was drawing blanks in many of them. He tried to retrieve what he learned from the deepest crevices of his mind, but much of that information had been lost to time. The same thing happened in the Physics perio, where he struggled to remember the specifics of the laws and formulas he’d been taught. Both times he had to click submit on the Chromebook, he was incredibly unconfident with his answers. When it was all over, everyone got up and began discussing the perios with their friends while Marco stayed in his seat.\n\t\n\tSoon, everyone began to leave the room, wanting to leave behind the experience of the perio retake forever. Marco, however, remained glued to his seat. After ten minutes, the only people left in the room were himself and Ma’am Lareigh, who was just about to leave. “Mananatili ka ba diyan…?” she asked, to which Marco nodded quickly. \n“Sige…patayin mo na lang yung mga ilaw,” she said as she carried her stuff and left the room. As soon as Ma’am was out of sight, Marco sunk his head downwards onto the tabletop. He concealed his face with both of his arms… \n\n…as he wept,\n\nand wept,\n\nand wept.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "content": "The weekend came and went for Marco. By the time Monday came around, he tried to pretend like everything was just fine. However, as he witnessed the flagcem and looked around, he realized that everyone had seemingly moved on from the retake. Aside from a tongue-in-cheek reference by that day’s speakers, it wasn’t talked about in the slightest. He knew people had heard about it, however, as he could hear distant mutterings of “3rd floor Audi” and “fell down” from students nearby. Marco tried to hold in his anger as everyone had seemingly continued on with their day. At one point, he locked eyes with Darren, who saw Marco and realized that he was not alright. Marco glanced downwards in shame, not wanting him to see the state he was in.\n\nMorning classes were unremarkable for Marco, and he bailed right when the bell rang and his lunch period began. He made his way to the library and sat on a table outside close to the entrance. After a few minutes of watching everyone who passed by, he spotted Glenn, just as he’d expected. “Hey, Glenn!” Marco called out, which took him by surprise. \n“Marco? Akala ko nasa ospital ka pa…?” he asked. \n“I got better,” Marco said smugly as he held his hands up to the air, with Glenn taking a seat adjacent to him. \n“What happened? Why’d you just…climb up there?” Glenn asked Marco. \n\n“...it’s a long story,” Marco replied.\n\n“Let’s go to the ASTB…someone’s waiting for us,” he told Glenn. They then both got up and walked towards the ASTB. After a minute, they made it there. This was one of those days where the whole place was surprisingly empty. Glenn then quickly spotted Brianna sitting at one of the tables. \n“She knows about it all. I told her everything. I also told her to come here while we were on the bus,” Marco explained. \n“I need to discuss something important. Those people we saw on the security cameras? They’re part of an…organization.”\n“They call themselves…the Rising Phoenix.” \nBrianna turned around after hearing their footsteps and waved at Marco. When they got to her table, they both sat down and made themselves comfortable. Marco then gave Glenn a quick summary of what happened to him.\n\n\t“Alright…now you both know what this is about,” Marco started off. \n“Last week, I successfully infiltrated the Rising Phoenix…and they tried to bribe me with my untouched perio papers.” \n\t“Wait, they didn’t burn yours? Why?” Glenn asked.\n\t“No…at least, not back then. They’ve probably destroyed it by now since I refused their offer,” Marco explained. \n“They thought I was weak…that they could manipulate me into being a part of their…operation. But they’re wrong. I’m better than that.” Marco paused for a bit to gather his thoughts.\n\t“...we have discovered something major. We stumbled upon a group of highly skilled and intelligent people with nothing to lose. They beat me to a pulp, for God’s sake. They don’t care who or what gets in their way. Their only goal is to bring Pisay crumbling down. And…I fear, if no one stops them…”\n\t“...they’ll succeed…?” Brianna chimed in, to which Marco nodded gently.\n“The Rising Phoenix is…as best as I can put it…a ghost in the machine. They’re a danger to everyone in Pisay, and we have to do everything we can to stop them.”\n\n“I want to form…a team…to investigate this. To stop them once and for all. I chose you two because…as of the moment, you’re the only people I can trust with this,” Marco explained. \n“What about Darren…?” Glenn asked. \n“Don’t you trust him with this?” To that, Marco had a pained look in his eyes. \n“You just don’t want him to get hurt, do you?” Brianna replied, to which Marco once again nodded gently to. \n“The Rising Phoenix could be anywhere…the students, the teachers…even other school employees could be in on it, I don’t know…!” he exclaimed, letting some of his raw emotion out. \n“I also have to warn you too that…this is a very dangerous endeavor. The Rising Phoenix will not show you mercy. I know that firsthand. If you don’t want to take that risk, you can leave. Does anyone want to leave?” Marco asked them.\n\n\tHe waited for a few seconds for them to respond. They continued to stay silent. “Sasali ako, pero hindi dahil sayo. Gusto ko lang masolusyonan ito,” Glenn explained. \n“Di ko alam…” Brianna told Marco. \n“It’s just a lot of responsibility, and…I dunno. I want to help you, but…yeah.” Marco nodded his head in understanding. \n“I get it. You don’t have to join if you feel you’ll be put in danger.”\n\t“Actually, you know what…? I think I’ll join…for now, at least,” said Brianna. “I know you need the help. I promise I’ll try my best.”\n\t\n\tWhile Brianna was deciding, Marco noticed someone from the corner of his eye. It was Prairie, who was sitting all by herself in the corner writing on her notebook. “Thanks, Bri. I knew I could count on you,” he told her. \n“I actually have another idea. You see Prairie over there…?” he asked as he pointed to her. \n“Di ko inakalang kilala mo yung mga batchmates natin, Marco,” Glenn remarked. \n“You think I should invite her to the team…? She could be really useful…”\n“Can’t be any worse than your other ideas,” Glenn joked.\n“Sure, go for it. As long as you can trust her, that is,” Brianna told him. Marco solidified his decision and got up to approach Prairie.\n\n“Hey Prairie…remember me?” Marco told her, which made her look up and stop writing in her notebook.  \n“Ay, naalala kita. Ikaw si Marco, diba?”\n“Yeah, that’s me. Sorry about the whole frisbee thing, by the way. I put a little too much force\nin it.”\n“Ok lang yan. Teka, hindi ba ikaw yung nahulog sa 3rd floor Audi?”\n“If you’re wondering, I’m fine. I’m all healed.”\n“Sige…anong kailangan mo? May natuklasan ka ba…?”\n“Yeah, about the camera thing…long story *very* short, we discovered a secret society in Pisay called the Rising Phoenix and I’m forming a team to take them down.”\n“Wow…dati na akong may hinala na may secret society dito sa Pisay. G ako,” Prairie quickly replied.\n“Oh! Well, that’s great…! The rest of us are over here…” Marco told her excitedly as he motioned to the table where Brianna and Glenn were sitting. \n\nPrairie quickly took a seat at the table while Marco came back to his. “So…welcome to the team!” Marco told Prairie. \n“So, this is - ” Before Marco could finish however, Prairie chimed in. \n“Ikaw si Glenn Arnold E. Duranca, at ikaw si Brianna A. Garcia,” she said as she pointed at both of them respectively. \n“Brianna ang kaisa-isang pangalan mo, diba?” asked Prairie, which Brianna confirmed. \n“Oh…I guess I don’t need to introduce you to them then,” Marco remarked surprisingly as he laid back on his chair. \n“Don’t know what I was expecting, since you’re a detective and all.”\n\n“Do you all know each other…?” Marco asked as he motioned towards the three of them. \n“Alam ko si Prairie, nasa Eme tayo noong Grade 7,” Brianna said as she looked towards her. \n“Pero si Glenn…hindi ko siya masyadong kilala. Yun lang.” Glenn readjusted himself in his seat and began to talk. \n“I don’t really know these two, but I hope we get along well. I’ll try at least,” he said as he looked at both of them. \n“Well, as for me, Brianna’s been my best friend since Grade 7, Glenn is someone I’ve…had a past with…” he said as he gave a discomforted glance towards him, \n“...and Prairie is someone I just found out about two weeks ago. So, yeah.”\n\n“So…ano na ang nalaman natin…?” Prairie asked excitedly as she opened her notebook and clicked her pen. \n“Ok, here’s everything I know…” Marco explained. \n“When I infiltrated the Rising Phoenix, I learned a few things. One, they’re looking for some kind of flash drive they lost a long time ago. Two, this drive is in the possession of a certain person codenamed ‘Radium’. That’s all I’ve got.”\n\n“Flash drive? What’s on it?” Glenn asked. \n“I don’t know what it contains, but it seems like they need it to continue their plans,” Marco replied. \n“USB, I assume. Sige.” \n“Teka, na-infiltrate mo sila…? Wow…” Prairie said, bewildered. \n“...naaalala mo ba ang mukha nila…?” she asked. \n“No…they were all wearing balaclavas, I couldn’t make out any features,” Marco explained. \n“Besides, even if I could see their faces, I wouldn’t remember it. I swear to God, I have protopriogenia, or whatever it’s called.”\n“Prosopagnosia,” Brianna blurted out. \n“Sorry…I felt like I needed to contribute somehow. Parang nandito lang ako eh.”\n\n“Ok…that’s the absolute basics of what you all need to know. Now we proceed forth…as a team,” said Marco. \n“Kung tayo’y magkakaisa,” Prairie asked, “...ano ang magiging pangalan ng ating grupo…?” Marco put his hand on his chin, not anticipating the question. \n“Um…I hadn’t really thought about that. Do you guys have any ideas?” he asked them. \n“Let’s call ourselves…The Destroyers of the Rising Phoenix,” Glenn suggested. \n“That’s way too on the nose, Glenn…” Marco replied, to which Brianna and Prairie silently nodded. Glenn pouted and slumped in his seat after that remark. Prairie motioned to Marco to give her more time to think, leaving only Brianna left to give a suggestion.\n\n“What about…Dexterous Detectives…?” Brianna suggested. \n“Hm…I like that,” Marco said gleefully. \n“Are we going with that?” he asked Glenn and Prairie, to which Glenn gave a reluctant thumbs up while Prairie gave complete approval. \n“Alright, everyone…this is it,” he said in a serious manner.\n\n“Dexterous Detectives…we’ve got work to do.”\n\n\t"

    "content": "It had been a month since they first decided to team up. Christmas break had passed, and the Dexterous Detectives were all still hard at work cracking the Rising Phoenix case - all while balancing their schoolwork at the same time. As it turns out, the Rising Phoenix really is good at hiding its tracks. In the meantime, Marco continued to practice combat every lunchtime in case he ever had to fight again, using the equipment in the exercise room of the gym to train. On this day, Brianna sat in the corner and helped him whenever necessary.\n\n“Alam mo na di mo ‘to kailangan gawin, diba?” Brianna asked Marco while he went to town on a punching bag. \n“I don’t know why you keep saying that, Bri,” he told her between punches and panting breaths.\n“Not what I meant, but ok.”\n“The next time they get me…I won’t be so lucky. They won’t pull their punches. You know what…why did you come with me anyway…?”\n“...Wala kong magawa, e,” Brianna told him.\n“That, and there’s something I’ve never really…told you about.”\n\nMarco stopped punching and grabbed a towel to dry off his sweat. \n“You can tell me after I'm done training my punches,” he told her. As he said this, however, the top of the punching bag snapped, dropping it to the ground and startling Marco. It then fell towards him, spilling some of its stuffing on his feet. \n“...On second thought, you can tell me now…” he told her sheepishly.\n\n“So…you may think of me as some basic girl, but I actually know quite a few maneuvers myself…” Brianna told Marco as she unfurled a long mat on the floor.\n“Right, you told me about this…” Marco replied.\n“It was because of - ” Marco blurted out before stopping himself. \n“Sorry, I forgot I can’t talk about…”\n“Okay lang yan. I know it wasn’t on purpose.”\n\n“Anyway…in real life, you can’t just punch your way out of every fight. Minsan, kailangan mong ma-outmaneuver yung kalaban mo. Halika rito,” she said as she motioned to Marco to step on the mat.\n“I watched a video about karate moves last night, I think I know what I’m do - ”\nIn the blink of an eye, Brianna grabbed Marco by the arm and the leg and threw him down on the mat. Marco let out a huge grunt when his body hit the floor.\n“Aray ko! Ano ka ba…?!” Marco shouted angrily while Brianna laughed in the background.\n\n“That’s the stuff you can’t learn by just watching a YouTube video…you have to do it…in the flesh!” she exclaimed. \n“You…fish sandwich!” Marco yelled at her as he got back up on his feet.\n“...Fish sandwich?”\n“Whatever, Bri! Just…can’t we try something less intense first? Like fencing, for example!” he told her as he picked up some heavy sticks off the floor.\n“Para sa arnis ‘yan, Marco…” she told him with an unamused look on her face.\n“It’s just a little sport, Brianna…care to try?” Marco asked her smugly.\n“Fine…but I don’t see the point of this,” she told him reluctantly as she caught one of the arnis sticks that Marco had tossed to her. They stepped foot on the mat and began their friendly match.\n\n“See? Now this is actually fun…!” Marco told Brianna as they exchanged a few light hits with their sticks.\n“To you maybe…but you know this isn’t going to help! Do you really think they’re going to use *swords* to fight you…?!” Brianna asked him angrily as they started exchanging more hits.\n“Oh, give me a break, Bri…I’ve been stressing over the Rising Phoenix non-stop, just let me have some fun this *one* time!” he told her as he began to back Brianna to her end of the mat. Soon, she began to push Marco back towards his own.\n\n“That’s all you ever talk about with me nowadays, Marco! Rising Phoenix this, Rising Phoenix that! What ever happened to having regular conversations…like whether Taylor or Ariana is better…?!” she argued as her hits became more and more frequent and forceful.\n“If the Rising Phoenix wins, Pisay falls! As long as Obsidian’s still out there, stopping them is priority number one!” Marco yelled out. \n“...and for the record, Taylor is better! Ari’s new album *sucked*!”\n“No it DOESN’T!” Brianna yelled back. As she said this, Marco attempted to swing his stick towards her, but she quickly dodged it and used the opportunity to win. She thrust her stick at Marco’s torso, which made contact. As soon as he realized what happened, Marco dropped his stick on the floor.\n\n“...I’m sorry you feel that way, Brianna. We can talk more about it later…” he told her.\n“You played a good game, by the way,” he added as he offered a handshake. \n“Have you done this before…?” he asked.\n“No…I’m just that good,” she explained as she shook his hand.\n“I gotta go to the bathroom…” she told Marco as she walked towards the door. \n“By the way, your detectives are here. Go deal with them,” she said nonchalantly as she pointed to Glenn and Prairie, who were entering the area. She went straight to the bathroom as the two walked up to Marco.\n\n“Hey guys…!” Marco greeted them. \n“...anything new? I haven’t seen much progress in a while.”\nGlenn motioned to Prairie who was excitedly holding her notepad. \n“You do the honors,” he told her. Prairie cleared her throat before explaining what they’d found. \n“Ok…sa wakas, may lead na tayo!” she explained.\n“Really? How’d you guys do it?” Marco asked enthusiastically.\n\n“So I *may* have spent the past month tapping into Pisay’s Wi-Fi and servers and extracting all its contents…” Glenn explained to Marco, who was gobsmacked. \n“If they find out about this, we are *so* screwed...” Marco said as he rubbed the bottom of his forehead with his fingers.\n“We? Nah, if they find out about this I’m pinning it on you the first chance I get,” Glenn retorted. Marco gave him an unamused glare soon after he said it.\n“Just, continue…” Marco requested.\n“Gayunpaman, gumawa si Glenn ng program na nagpadala ng laman ng mga servers sa akin. At hulaan mo kung anong nakita ko kagabi...” Prairie explained as she opened her phone and showed Marco a picture from her gallery.\n\n“What is this…?” he asked.\n“It’s an unencrypted series of messages between what we believe to be two members of the Rising Phoenix. They messed up, it was on public Wi-Fi somehow…” Glenn explained.\n“From the messages, we’ve deduced that two members codenamed Hexane and Octane are going to meet at the backmost left table of the library tomorrow Wednesday at 12 noon,” Prairie outlined further.\n“Wait, tomorrow? But there’s gonna be a school-wide event at the gym…we’re all required to be there!” Marco exclaimed.\n\n“Huwag mag-alala…may kilala akong tutulong diyan. Pupunuin lang niya ang attendance para sa’tin,” Glenn reassured Marco.\n“We’re just piling the offenses on now, aren’t we…”\n“If I remember correctly, *you’re* the one who started this whole team thing.”\n“Fine…but just this once,” Marco told him.\n“They may be meeting to exchange the flash drive…we can’t mess this up.”\nMarco continued discussing the finding with Glenn and Prairie, reassuring them both that he would inform Brianna about it later.\n\nAfter dismissal arrived, Marco soon found himself wandering around the ASTB hall, unsure of how he could kill time before the bus would leave. He soon noticed Darren at the back ASTB, staring placidly at the pond. He quickly went out the glass doors and joined him.\n“Oh, uh, hey, Marco…!” Darren exclaimed, not expecting Marco to show up.\n“Looks like I caught you by surprise this time, huh?” Marco teased.\n“Haha, yeah…” Darren replied.\n\n“So…what brings you here…?” Marco asked him.\n“Ewan…gusto ko lang…magpahinga.”\n“We’re in Pisay. Don’t we all?”\nThe two shared a laugh as they continued to take in the surroundings. Soon, a flock of ducks arrived and began to chew on the plants growing in the pond.\n\n“Aww…it’s a bunch of duckies…!” Marco said in a cutesy tone as he pointed at them.\n“Hey, Marco…did you know that ducks can fly so high, airplanes can hit them?” Darren told him.\n“Woah…that’s crazy. Not really something I want to think about while looking at ducks, though.”\n“Oh…oh my God, I’m so sorry…! I should’ve said something different…” Darren apologized profusely.\n“Haha, don’t worry, it’s fine. At least you’re passionate about something, am I right?”\n“Yeah, haha…” Darren replied nervously. They stood in silence afterwards as they watched the ducks come and go.\n\n“You know, I miss the elem days…we were way closer back then,” Darren recalled.\n“I miss them too. When I’m with you, I feel like I can just…forget about everything for a while.”\n“R-really…?”\n“Yeah. I’m not very good at making friends…I shouldn’t have let our friendship…slip.”\n“Well, we can start again now…” Darren suggested.\n“Yeah…we can do that.” After Marco said this, another round of silence followed.\n\n“Before I go, there’s something I wanted to ask you…” Darren told Marco.\n“What is it…?”\n“Um, do you…uh…do…you…” Darren said, stumbling on his words as a confused Marco stared at him.\n“Do you…know when our Math AA is due…?” Darren asked.\n“Oh. Um, January 16, I think,” Marco replied.\n“Ok, thanks, gotta go, bye…!” Darren told Marco as he ran to the drop-off area, leaving him at the pond. Although still befuddled by the whole encounter, Marco put it aside and thought about the plan he was going to execute come Wednesday. He knew it had to go right. \n\n\nIt was the only way.\n\n"

    "title": "INTERFERENCE",
    "content": "The next day, Wednesday rolled around. After hiding out behind the ASTB for a while, Marco, Glenn, and Prairie started hurrying over to the library as 12 noon inched closer. Absolutely no one was in sight - even the security guards, as they were in the middle of a reshuffling and were also attending the event at the gym. On the way there, Marco decided to go over the plan once more.\n“Alright, let’s go over everything one last time, just to be safe. Is that ok?” he asked Glenn and Prairie, to which they agreed.\n“Here we go…”\n\n“So, Brianna’s stationed over at our interrogation area, hopefully…” Marco explained as he walked up to the windows of the back ASTB, waving to Brianna, who was guarding the entrance to the ASTB AVR. She noticed him waving and gave him a thumbs-up of reassurance.\n“Anyway, I’ll go over everything again…Glenn, you’re staying in the old DSA. Don’t leave the room under *any* circumstances, ok?” he told him. \n“Make sure the cameras in and around the library are frozen, even though the Rising Phoenix probably already have. And listen in on the audio I’m picking up. All of it.”\n“Got it…and I checked, they froze the cams already,” Glenn said as he nodded intently.\n\n“Prairie, you’ve installed the bug under their table, right?” Marco asked Prairie, which she gave a thumbs-up to.\n“Good…you guys should be able to hear whatever they say. You stay in the old DSA with Glenn and listen as well,” Marco told her.\n“Alalahanin mo, dapat tayong dalawa magpansinan. Listening device lang yan...nasira ang record function,” Glenn added.\n“As for me, I’ll hide nearby and listen to the conversation in case the bug malfunctions,” Marco told them both.\n“Uy, talaga? Bakit?” Prairie asked, surprised. \n“Paano kung makita ka nila?”\n\n“Look, I *know* I’m taking a risk, but this is our only chance to learn something! And I’m not going to risk potentially missing out on it,” he explained to her.\n“Sige. Sana alam mo ang ginagawa mo,” she told him.\n“By the way…thanks Glenn. You’re a lifesaver,” Marco told him.\n“That’s the gift of being able to take military tech from your dad without permission…!” Glenn replied, prompting Marco to sigh lightly.\n“Alright…let’s go. It’s 11:47,” Marco told them both.\n\nA few minutes later, they all got into position. Glenn and Prairie sat down around Glenn’s laptop in the old DSA while Marco hid behind a bookshelf near the table where members Hexane and Octane were set to meet. Glenn and Prairie both put on an earbud each, which were connected to the listening device. All three were tense as they waited for the two members to show up. Eventually, Glenn and Prairie heard two pairs of very faint footsteps outside and Marco heard the library doors open. They showed up - 12 on the dot. \n“They’re here. Get ready,” he messaged Glenn and Prairie on their end-to-end encrypted group chat on his phone. \n“Oh, shoot…” Glenn muttered after seeing the message. He quickly signaled Prairie to come over and listen to the audio feed.\n\nMarco tensed up as he heard their footsteps slowly approach his vicinity. He got flashbacks to when he snuck into the Rising Phoenix meeting, which notably ended in his hospitalization. He managed to compose himself and decided to carefully peek out of the bookshelf to see Hexane and Octane’s faces. To his surprise, they weren’t wearing their bird masks. \n\nHexane and Octane took a seat at the left backmost library table, which Glenn and Prairie found out when their device sent sounds of them pulling the chairs, much to their relief. \n“So…what do you want to talk about, Hexane?” Octane asked.\n“You know we’re alone, right? You don’t have to call me that,” Hexane told him annoyedly. Marco, Glenn, and Prairie held their breath, trying to hear if they would drop their names.\n“I know, but…let’s maintain formality, shall we…?” Octane replied, which Hexane begrudgingly agreed to, leaving the trio slightly disappointed.\n\n“About our meeting here, honestly…I wanted us to meet so I could get out of the gym. I don’t wanna stay there for 5 hours! And I like the aircon here…it’s nice,” Hexane explained, prompting Octane to sigh deeply in disdain.\n“We’re so lucky we haven’t been kicked out yet. We’re too reckless, you and I…one day our luck is going to run out,” Octane warned him. \n“Let’s just get this over with,” Hexane told Octane.\n\n“We need to talk about Radium. If we don’t find them soon, Obsidian is not going to be happy. You know what happened the last time we disappointed him,” he continued.\n“Mhm. I remember that day like it was yesterday…”\n“If we fail him again…he will never let us forget it. I’m…terrified…of him, honestly.”\n“So am I.”\n“...then you know why we need this meeting.”\n\n“So about Radium…” Hexane said before Octane interrupted him.\n“Stop calling them that…they’re not a part of us anymore,” Octane requested sternly.\n“They don’t deserve to be treated like one of us. Call them who they really are. Just plain old, traitorous Ramone.” Marco, Glenn, and Prairie were taken aback by this name drop. Prairie quickly jotted it down on her trusty notepad.\n“We need to think of something we haven’t tried with them. They’re completely off the grid. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram…all gone. Digital records…altered. Their friends aren’t of any use either. How else are we supposed to find them…?” Octane asked him.\n\n“About that…I wanted to tell you about something. Voltage and I managed to set up a meeting with them. Saturday this week, 2PM, 4th Floor Audi” Hexane detailed to Octane. Prairie quickly wrote down the day and time on her notepad while Glenn made sure the audio feed worked, with both of them focused like never before. Marco sat as still as he could behind the bookshelf, trying to remember every single word they said. However, Glenn and Prairie’s hearts jumped when they heard the door click. Someone knew they were there. The door opened…and it was Sir Ernest.\n\n“Anong ginagawa niyo dito?!” he angrily asked the both of them. Glenn shifted the computer screen away from Sir Ernest’s view while Prairie stuttered trying to come up with an explanation. \n“Dapat nasa gym kayo, importante ‘yan! Required ‘yun!” he continued to a still-mortified Glenn and Prairie.\n“Why are you here then, Sir…?” Glenn fired back at him.\n“Why I’m here is not important. As students, you are required to attend. Come with me!” he ordered them.\nMeanwhile, Hexane and Octane were still talking about their meetup with Ramone, with Marco listening intently in the background.\n\n“How did you get them to agree? They’ve been on the run for months now…!” Octane asked.\n“Turns out money is a big motivator for them…I agreed to give them 100,000 pesos if they showed up with the drive.”\n“Wait, where did you get that money? That didn’t come from the redistribution fund, did it…?” Octane asked once again.\n“Look…we were barely using any of it. At least it’s going to something that will advance our cause. We need the program to succeed!”\n“Hexane…we didn’t carefully take Pisay funds under the admin’s noses for *years* just so we can blow it all on something that may or may not actually be real…!” Marco could only sit there and be shocked at this revelation. They were committing actual serious crimes, he thought. And he didn’t have the recording to prove it.\n\nMeanwhile at the old DSA, Sir Ernest was still scolding Glenn and Prairie, causing them not to hear what Hexane admitted.\n“Sir, tinatapos lang namin ang naming Socsci project, pasensya na…” Prairie fibbed. Glenn backed up her lie and begged Sir Ernest to let them stay there.\n“Tama na! Magkaka-NCR na kayong dalawa!” Sir told them. He took out a pen and two NCRs and began writing their names.\n“Glenn Arnold Duranca at Pearl Arianne Amihan…” Sir said as he looked at their IDs, to which they both sheepishly nodded their heads. Glenn felt irritated, as he prided himself in never receiving an NCR throughout his entire stay in Pisay so far.\n“Sa susunod, ayusin niyo ‘yung time management niyo. Wala nang excuses!” Sir told them sternly before leaving the room in a huff. Glenn and Prairie were relieved that Sir didn’t force them out of the room. After he left, they both quickly returned to listening to the audio feed. Unfortunately, they’d missed a lot of the incriminating admissions of Hexane and Octane while Sir interrupted them.\n\nWhile Glenn and Prairie were dealing with Sir, Hexane and Octane argued about the use of the stolen money to bring Ramone out from hiding. Hexane pulled out his burner phone and explained to Octane that Ramone reached out to him first. He had requested a unique selfie and information only they would know, proving it was actually them. This convinced Octane to go along with the plan.\n“So…what do you need me for…?” Octane asked.\n“Voltage needs backup in case things go wrong. She asked me to support her, but she wants another member to help. Are you down?”\n“Of course. Anything for the Rising Phoenix.”\n“And by the way, you could’ve just messaged me about this…” Octane remarked.\n\n“Ay, shemay…” Glenn remarked, as he couldn’t hear anything out of his earbud.\n“Alam ko na talaga…masyadong sira na ito,” he continued to complain as he tried to adjust the volume on the earbud. In doing so, he accidentally sent a surge of volume through the listening device, which manifested on the other end.\n“What was that…?” Hexane asked frantically as he stood up from his chair. He looked under the table and found the device embedded under the table. \n\n“Someone’s been listening to us…we need to get out of here!” he told Octane in a panicked tone as he put on his bird mask, which he’d kept in his pocket the whole time. Marco heard this and realized they’d been found out. Prairie heard them say this on her earbud and realized it too. \n“Get the bug…I’m leaving!” Hexane ordered as he ran to the exit, pocketing his burner phone. Prairie knew she had to do something. She quickly jumped out of her seat and ran out of the old DSA, giving Glenn no time to react.\n\nAs soon as Hexane opened the entrance, Prairie charged at him and pushed him backwards. He quickly tried to sprint past her while the door was still open, but she managed to grab his hand. He tried desperately to pull it away while keeping the door open at the same time. Eventually, Hexane managed to out-strength her and pulled his hand away. He quickly ran out the door and away from the scene as Prairie fell to the ground from exhaustion. Suddenly, she heard Marco’s voice faintly echoing from the back of the library.\n\nWhile Hexane tried to escape, Octane tried to remove the device from the underside of the table to no avail. As he did this, Marco quietly emerged from behind the bookshelf and snuck up on him. When he couldn’t remove it, Octane resorted to bashing it in with his fist repeatedly. By the fifth punch, Marco had made it behind Octane. He quickly grabbed him by the front collar and faced him towards him. \n“Got you,” Marco told him, freezing him in his tracks. Prairie quickly ran to Marco and backed him up. Octane, realizing he was outnumbered, surrendered to the pair. \n\n“We’re going to need a lot more answers from you,” Marco taunted him as they brought him out of the library, with Marco tightly holding one arm and Prairie the other. Glenn, seeing them both with Octane, breathed a sigh of relief to himself. He packed up his stuff and joined them to the ASTB AVR.\n\n"

    "content": "A few minutes later, Marco, Prairie, and Glenn brought a now despondent Octane to the ASTB AVR where Brianna was impatiently waiting. \n“About time…” Brianna muttered to Marco as she opened the door. The room was pitch black save for a few rays of light escaping from the back windows. A single yellow-tinted lamp sitting on a table in front of the projector screen provided the main source of light of the entire room. One of the chairs had a single rope left on it by Prairie beforehand.\n\nThe group swiftly got everything set up - Marco and Prairie sat Octane on one of two chairs at the table while Glenn tied Octane’s hands to it tightly using Prairie’s rope. Prairie quickly took out her laptop and opened up a bunch of tabs. Meanwhile, Brianna shut and locked the door and pulled the chair opposite Octane for Marco to sit in. \n“I hope you know what you’re doing…” Brianna told him.\n“By the way,” Marco clarified to Brianna, “I’ll play bad cop…you be good cop.”\n“Bakit ikaw yung bad cop…?”\n“Because I’m bad at everything.”\n\nBrianna, Glenn, and Prairie took a seat on the side as Marco sat down in front of Octane. He adjusted the lamp to better light Octane’s face and began the interrogation.\n“State your name for the record,” Marco ordered Octane. Prairie was nearby, recording the whole interrogation on her phone. The room continued to remain silent, with the faint buzz of the lamp providing the only audible sound. After 10 seconds, Octane let out a light chuckle.\n“Marco, walang kwenta ‘yan. Nalaman ko na kung sino siya.” she informed him. \n“His name is Jorge Ramiel S. Dela Cruz. He's in Grade 10.” Octane was left with a shocked expression on his face as he heard the words come out of her mouth.\n“Seems she’s right then,” Marco remarked as he noticed his expression. “So they’re making lower years do their work for them. Shameful…”\n\n“As you can see…we already know a lot about you. So unless you want us to make your life a living hell,” Marco said menacingly as he stood up and put his hands on the table, \n“...then you should talk.”\n“First off,” Marco said as he sat back down, “Who is Ramone? Their full name. Say it.”\n“...never,” Octane refused meekly.\n“SAY IT!” Marco yelled as he slammed the table.\n“Alright, alright! Their name is Ramone Villanueva…they’re Grade 11! They went on leave last school year, and we’ve been trying to find them ever since…” Octane answered. Prairie looked at her laptop once more as Glenn and Brianna watched intently.\n\n“Totoo ang sinasabi niya…” Prairie confirmed. \n“Estudyante si Ramone Alekhine T. Villanueva sa nakaraang taon…tapos nag-LOA siya.”\n“Why did they LOA…?” Marco questioned further.\n“I don’t know…they were probably just trying to get away from us…and it worked.”\n“And they took the drive with them?”\n“Yes…they went rogue. It was a shock to all of us. Just shows that you can’t trust anyone.”\n“Why do they want to meet with you this week, of all weeks?”\n“I don’t know…I swear!”\n\nMarco took a deep sigh. He knew deep down that Octane really didn’t know the reason. He stood up and moved his body closer to Octane.\n“...what’s in that drive? You mentioned a program. What is it?” he asked Octane.\n“I’d rather *die* than tell you,” he fired back instantly. Marco immediately realized that this was a piece of information he wouldn’t be able to extract, so he moved on to other questions.\n“How long has the Rising Phoenix existed…?”\n“Longer than you think,” Octane answered jeeringly.\n\n“How many people are involved in this…?”\n“More than 1,” Octane told Marco, who was starting to get agitated.\n“Is the Rising Phoenix in other campuses…?!”\n“We’re *everywhere*,” Octane said very smugly. Marco had enough. He made his way over to Octane’s chair and turned it towards himself. \n“GIVE ME A REAL ANSWER!” he shouted as he shook the chair, but it had no effect. The shaking partially loosened the rope on Octane’s hands.\n\n“I am giving real answers,” Octane replied.\n“Look at you. Chasing ghosts. Endlessly running around in a game of cat and mouse, trying so hard to prove that you’re not just a *failure.*” Marco angrily brought the chair closer as he heard this.\n“But you can’t win. You know why? Because you don’t trust anyone. And you shouldn’t. Anyone you meet…your classmates, your teachers…and even your own friends…could be one of us.” As Octane said this, Marco looked over to a concerned Brianna, Glenn, and Prairie.\n“The Rising Phoenix will be victorious…and there’s *nothing* you can do.” After Octane said this, Marco began to hyperventilate. At that point, Brianna quickly stood up and brisk walked over to the two to put an end to it. \n“That’s ENOUGH!” she told Marco. After a few seconds, he let go of the chair and walked away from Octane with Brianna.\n\n“You need to stop,” Brianna told Marco earnestly. \n“Naaapektuhan ka na. Magpahinga ka na muna sa labas,” she suggested.\n“I think she’s right,” Glenn added. Marco took a deep sigh before admitting it.\n“Yeah…I think I need some time off…” he told the two.\n“...I’m gonna go outside for a bit. Brianna, you interrogate him now,” he ordered.\n“I’ll come with you,” Glenn told Marco, which he was fine with.\n“Ok…not like you were doing anything anyway,” Marco replied snarkily. They both exited the room, leaving Prairie and Brianna in charge of the interrogation.\n\nGlenn leaned on the wooden table that was left outside the door while Marco sat down on the floor. Marco soon took another deep breath and rested his head on his knees.\n“I’m not cut out for this…” he told Glenn.\n“Oo…para kang sumabog doon,” he replied.\n“He’s right though. I am obsessing over this…and I dragged you all into this with me.”\n“Naiintindihan ko naman ‘yan,”\n“Oh…” Marco replied.\n“I…wasn’t expecting you to say that.”\n“Why not?” Glenn asked. \n“...you still think I’m insufferable, don’t you?” he told Marco.\n\n“Maybe a little…you know, why *are* you being so cooperative with me in the first place?” Marco asked Glenn.\n“Even though I still think you’re hella annoying…” Glenn explained,\n“...I can’t deny that you’re really smart. You’re better in Physics than I could ever be. Point is, talent recognizes talent. And I’m not closed-minded enough to let some olympiad incident get in the way of that.”\n“Oh…” Marco let out, surprised that Glenn was showing such maturity.\n“And this whole Rising Phoenix thing threatens everyone here…so I’d like to be remembered as the guy that helped put a stop to it.”\n“Yeah…me too,” Marco replied.\nThey stayed there for a few minutes, waiting for Prairie and Brianna to be done with the interrogation. After a while, the door opened. It was Brianna.\n\n“It’s no use…” she told the two. \n“He won’t budge. I tried, he just won’t say anything - ” \n*BAM!* While Brianna was still speaking, Octane shoved her out of the way as hard as he could and ran down the stairs nearest to the ASTB AVR. Her body quickly brought Glenn and Marco to the ground as Octane was getting away. Immediately, Marco moved her out of the way and began running after him as fast as he could.\n\nHe knew there was no way he could let him escape.\n\n"

    "content": "Marco ran down the stairs after Octane as fast as possible, with Brianna running right after him. A shocked Glenn once again stayed behind and watched them run after him. On the stairs, Marco jumped over the last few steps to get to Octane faster, and did it again near the bottom of the staircase. Octane dashed through the empty ASTB hall as Marco quickly thought of a plan.\n“BRI…!” he yelled, which she heard.\n“Go there!” he said as he motioned over to the front entrance of the ASTB with the turnstiles. Brianna understood this and ran out the glass doors.\n\nMeanwhile, Marco chased Octane through the corridor housing the Infinity, Optimum, and Frontier Lab. He could already feel himself losing his breath from running so fast, but he continued to push himself as Octane was still a decent distance away from him. As he ran out the back entrance, the turnstile reminded him to *“Please slightly move forward”*. Marco leaped over the granite stairs and made a hard left, still chasing after Octane. From the distance, Marco saw Brianna coming from the left side and getting in the way. However, Octane just shoved her out of the way again and ran past her.\n\nMarco jumped over Brianna and chased Octane through the BLOB. Brianna quickly got back up and started running again. As he was exiting the BLOB, Marco noticed a black go-kart with its engine at the back. It was parked in The Oval for a SCALE class later that day. He also saw something else that chilled him to the bone - Obsidian. He stood there in his black coat and red bird mask, staring at Marco all the while. Marco could feel everything fade away as he locked on to him. After a few seconds, Obsidian reached into his coat and pulled out 4 small, transparent orbs with a clear liquid in them and some sort of mechanism at the top. He gave them to Octane as he ran by him and began making his retreat. Octane jumped into the go-kart and began to start it.\n\nMarco knew this was bad. He couldn’t chase both of them at once. He quickly looked back and saw Brianna running right behind him.\n“Get him…! I’ll get the go-kart!” he called out to her as he pointed to Obsidian. He ran over the grate, jumped over the ledge, and ran to Octane before he could get the go-kart moving. Meanwhile, Brianna followed his orders and began chasing Obsidian into the mini-forest beside the boy’s dormitory.\n\nAs Marco inched closer and closer to the go-kart, he could feel his heart racing. He’d never ran this fast in his entire life. Just before he reached the go-kart, Octane started it and took off, belching a cloud of gray smoke at Marco’s face. Marco refused to give up and kept running after the go-kart, which was clearly too fast for him to catch up to. By the time he reached the section of the asphalt in the middle of the Kala Lane, he was completely out of breath and stopped on the spot, leaning on his knees to get even an ounce of energy back. From the corner of his eye, he saw Darren with his bike at one of the tables, much to his surprise.\n\n“Darren…?” Marco asked as he panted heavily.\n“What…are…you…doing here?”\n“I just snuck out to fix my bike before SCALE started…what is going on?” Darren answered.\n“Can’t…explain. I…need that…bike!” Marco told him.\nAs Marco finished speaking, he noticed the go-kart drift hard, doing a 180-degree turn in the process. Confused, he stood back up, having regained most of his energy. He looked over the distance and noticed the go-kart getting closer…and closer. Marco quickly realized he was about to get run over, and at the last second jumped off to the side, barely dodging it. He rolled on the ground before Darren caught him in his arms. \n“Thanks…” Marco told him sheepishly.\nAfter reaching the end of the Kala Lane, the go-kart did another 180-degree turn before driving off once again. Seeing this, Marco realized he needed that bike quick.\n\n“Hey…what are you doing?!” Darren exclaimed as Marco began to take his bike. The go-kart zipped by as Marco was getting the bike upright. \n“Sorry…need to borrow this for a while,” Marco explained before getting on and biking off to chase Octane once more. Darren ran out to the asphalt and watched Marco chase the go-kart on his bike, being both slightly annoyed and incredibly confused. \n\nMeanwhile, Brianna followed Obsidian into the forest but quickly lost track of him. As she entered, her shoes crunched the leaves strewn around the area. She looked around and couldn’t find any visible footsteps. Carefully, she looked at all the trees to see if he was hiding behind one of them. None of these are big enough to hide a whole person, she thought to herself. She quickly began making her way to the giant cotton tree in the middle of the forest. Walking slowly, she looked behind the tree and was surprised to find nobody behind it. Suddenly, someone grabbed her by the arm.\n\nAt The Oval, Marco pedaled with all his strength trying to catch up to Octane, who was once again a good distance away from him. As he made it to the curve of the oval nearest to the drop-off, he made sure to avoid the concrete slabs placed near the entrance, which Octane had simply driven over. Marco made sure to stay on the asphalt to avoid the risk of getting stuck in the grass. As Octane looked back, he was surprised to see that Marco was gaining on him. As they both neared the grandstand, Octane picked up one of the clear orbs Obsidian gave to him. He bit down on the top part and ripped it off with his teeth, releasing a hissing sound. He then chucked it behind him in the direction of Marco’s bike.\n\nMarco saw this and was puzzled. The orb landed on the road and rolled a few times before exploding into a cloud of smoke. It was a smoke grenade! Startled, Marco biked through it, nearly losing his balance from the temporary loss of vision and coughing. Octane looked behind again and saw that Marco was still in pursuit, much to his annoyance. Octane drove over the rocky entrance to The Oval, which bumped the go-kart around. He managed to pass it though, making his way back onto the road. Marco quickly followed, but not before noticing Obsidian run out of the forest with Brianna nowhere to be seen. He quickly realized what had happened - she was outmatched. He soon managed to make it onto the road, still pursuing Octane.\n\nOctane grabbed another smoke grenade and bit off the fuse before throwing it at Marco. Seeing this, he quickly swerved away from the explosion and managed to avoid the cloud of smoke. Octane turned hard to the left, which Marco also managed to do with his bike, but not without nearly falling off of it. Octane thought of something quick - as they passed by the gymnasium, he jerked the steering wheel to the side, making it do another 180-degree turn. He quickly pulled the reverse lever and brought the steering wheel back to the middle. He was now driving backwards, ready to hit Marco with another smoke grenade. He armed another one and threw it right at Marco’s face. Marco reached his hand out in front of him and - caught it with his bare hand. \n\nOctane let out a gasp as Marco held the orb in his hand, chuckling. He threw the smoke grenade back at Octane, which promptly blew up in his face. While in a fit of coughing, Octane turned the go-kart back around before the next hard turn - the one leading to the drop-off area. He turned just in the nick of time, creating a lot of smoke from the tire friction. Marco expertly navigated the corner before beginning to bike straight towards Octane. Worried, he threw another smoke grenade out, which Marco simply swatted away. Marco began to get closer and closer to the go-kart, which began to freak Octane out.\n\nAs they were exiting the drop-off area, Marco saw the construction near the flagpole area once more - the one he first noticed at the beginning of the quarter. Looking at it more, he realized that it was very ramp-like. Looking at the angle and estimating his current speed, he used his physics knowledge to determine that if he rode over it, he would end up on top of Octane. Plan in mind, he biked onto the sidewalk behind the flagpole and focused on the ramp. It got closer…and closer…and closer. Octane looked over and was confused at what he was doing. Suddenly, Marco turned right and rode over the ramp, sending him flying in the air.\n\nIt was as if time slowed down for Octane as he saw Marco fly towards him. Marco lost grip on the bike handlebars and braced for impact. *SLAM!* In an instant, he landed on the go-kart’s engine and fell into the cockpit with Octane, damaging it and making it start to overheat. Meanwhile, the bike’s front wheel landed on a part sticking out of the engine, which left it hanging off the back of the go-kart. Octane quickly took a swing at Marco, which landed amidst the chaos. Marco blocked his next punch and punched him back, making Octane grunt in pain. Seeing that they were near another turn, Octane jerked the steering wheel to the left with one hand, making Marco fall onto him. He used the other hand to try to push him off to no avail.\n\n“Stop this go-kart!” Marco yelled out, which Octane ignored. He saw that they were heading straight into the blue-barriered construction site behind the ASTB, which Marco hadn’t noticed yet. He slammed onto the gas pedal, breaking it and leaving it perpetually pressed. Marco turned his head and noticed they were about to crash, which gave Octane the opportunity to deliver a hard blow to his chest. He tripped and fell into the cockpit backfirst, allowing Octane to climb onto the engine and towards the bike that was hanging on. He walked onto it and began stomping the back wheel several times. \n\nMeanwhile, Marco managed to get up and saw Octane kicking the bike wheel. Before he could grab him, Octane threw his whole body onto the wheel, resulting in it breaking off and landing on the road with him curled up on it. He had gotten away - now Marco was piloting a go-kart that was about to crash head-on into a wall. With just a few meters before collision, Marco barely had any time to think. He climbed up the left side and quickly jumped off right before the go-kart crashed. He hit the sidewalk hard while the go-kart slammed into the barrier, creating a fiery explosion that sent go-kart pieces everywhere. Luckily, none of them hit Marco or damaged any of the few cars nearby.\n\nA few moments later, Marco managed to muster the strength to get up, using his arms to lift his torso off the ground. He looked over and saw the fire from the crash burning strong, which made him sweat a little from the heat. Moreover, he saw Darren’s bike in pieces, which made him feel extremely guilty. As he looked to the end of the road, he saw the bike wheel that Octane used to escape - but he was not on it. Suddenly, he was struck in the face with a metal gauntlet. He was knocked unconscious before he could see what - or who - hit him. As Marco lay on the ground, a student wearing a bird mask adjusted the gauntlet on his left hand.\n\n“I told you it would work,” the student told Obsidian, who was standing right beside him.\n“Good job, Overclock…” he complimented. \n“Your job here is done. Both of you, go back to the gym,” he told them. Overclock walked to Octane, who was standing nearby, and removed both the mask and the gauntlet. As they left, Obsidian knelt down and looked at Marco’s unconscious body.\n\n“The Rising Phoenix always wins, Marco. Always,” he said before getting up and leaving.\n\n"

    "content": "After the event at the gym concluded, Marco’s unconscious body and the charred remains of the go-kart were quickly discovered behind the ASTB. He was quickly brought to PCMC, treated, and sent back home - all of which felt like one big blur to Marco. He half-woke up when he was being wheeled into the ER; all he could remember were masked doctors looking over him and spouting medical jargon he couldn’t understand. When he was all fixed up and on the way back home, Marco’s mom had nothing to say. She was clearly livid. However, Marco was so tired that he dozed off in the backseat as soon as he got in the car. He was spared for that day.\n\nThe very next day, he was ordered to go to the Discipline Office immediately upon arriving on campus. He still had bandages on from the cuts he sustained falling off the go-kart, but he was still in good enough condition to come to school. Marco knew this wasn’t good - he would be facing the wrath of Sir Ernest once more. After dropping his bags off on a table at the FLOB, he slowly walked up to the entrance of the DO, trembling from fear. He placed his finger on the doorbell, but couldn’t bring himself to press it. He took a deep breath before finally pressing the button, prompting Sir Ernest to open the door.\n“Marco…pasok ka,” he told him.\n\nMarco made his way to the far end of the couch and sat down while Sir stood a few feet away. A few seconds of silence filled the room before Sir started to talk.\n“Anong pinaggagagawa mo…?” Sir said in a calm, but clearly restrained, manner.\n“You won’t understand,” Marco replied.\n“‘Di mo lang tinakasan ang isang required school event…” Sir explained angrily, “…pero nagnakaw ka rin ng go-kart na para sa SCALE at binangga mo pa sa bisikleta ng isa pang estudyante! At ngayon, pareho silang wasak! ANONG MASASABI MO?!”\n“Who told you that? That is *not* what happened!” Marco inquired.\n\n“Meron akong testimonya ng limang tao, at pare-pareho ang sinabi nila. Na *ikaw* ang salarin!” Sir explained as he pointed to Marco.\n“What about Glenn and Prairie? And Darren? Did you ask them?” Marco asked desperately.\n“Kahit tumatakas din sila, hindi nila na-witness ang nangyari. At binalewala namin ang testimonya ni Darren...pabago-bago ang kuwento niya. At magkaibigan kayong dalawa, kaya siguradong biased siya.”\n“That’s not fair! That’s not true, you have to believe me!”\n“Ano ang paliwanag mo? Sino ang gumawa nito, ha? Sabihin mo sa akin!”\n“Who were these so-called ‘witnesses’ who saw it? Because I can tell you, they’re making it up!” Marco asked furiously.\n“Hindi, confidential iyon. Di ko pwedeng sabihin sayo. Ang masasabi ko lang ay nagtitiwala ako sa mga source na ito...higit pa kay Darren.”\n“But why?!”\n“BASTA!”\n\nThe room once again fell completely silent. Sir was still incredibly angry while Marco felt utterly hopeless. A minute passed. Then two. Finally, Sir broke the silence.\n“Nagpatawad ako noon, pero ngayon, wala na ako ibang magagawa...” Sir told Marco as he faced away from him.\n“Maghahain ako ng Level 3 laban sa iyo para sa pagnanakaw na nagresulta sa pagkasira ng ari-arian...posibleng Level 4 kung papayagan ito ng Board of Trustees. Ipapaalam ko ito sa iyong magulang,” he told Marco.\nThe moment Marco heard those words, he was *devastated*. His life as he knew it was over. He wouldn’t be able to go to competitions and universities would avoid him like the plague - if he even got to finish high school. This was something that would loom over him for the rest of his life. He was done.\n“No…” he uttered in disbelief.\n“No, no, please, don’t do this to me, please…” Marco begged Sir Ernest as he clutched his hands together and began to sob. Suddenly, the door opened, causing Sir Ernest to stop for a moment.\n\nIn came Sir Ernest’s assistant. With her was a Grade 8 student who looked incredibly irritated. He had big, bushy hair, which Marco suspected was the reason he was brought in.\n“It’s him again, Sir…” she told Sir Ernest as she stepped back.\n“Maling haircut, walang ID *na naman*,” Sir told the boy as he approached him, confirming Marco’s suspicions.\n“Alam mo na ang gagawin ko. Ito ang iyong ika-12 na NCR...bibigyan kita ng pangalawang Level 1,” he said as walked up to the DO computer and inputted his newly gained offense.\n“I don’t understand why you kids can’t just follow the rules,” Sir remarked as the boy looked at him angrily.\n\n“This isn’t fair…” the boy muttered, which caught Sir Ernest’s attention.\n“Anong sinabi mo…?” Sir Ernest asked him.\n“It’s not fair…I get punished, but he gets off with none…” the boy replied.\n“Si Damian ba ang tinutukoy mo? Alam ko ang ginawa niya, pero maaaring magbago ang isang tao…kaya binigyan namin siya ng pagkakataon. At sayang naman na makahahadlang ang isang bagay na ganyan sa kanyang katalinuhan.\n“So I can’t grow too…?”\nSir Ernest fell silent. He took a deep breath and bent downwards slightly to address the boy.\n“Nandito ka dahil paulit-ulit mong ginagawa ‘to kahit alam mong hindi tama,” Sir fired back.\n“Kung ‘di mo masuot ng tama ang ID mo, talagang hindi ka matututo. Sa susunod, tumahimik ka at sumunod ka na lang. Malinaw ba?” Sir asked the boy, who reluctantly nodded as he looked down at his shoes.\n\n“Good…” Sir replied. He signaled to his assistant to escort him out of the room, which she promptly did. As the boy left the room, Marco spotted a disappointed, almost sad expression on the boy’s face. As Marco watched it all unfold, he couldn’t help but feel a lingering sense of disgust. \n“Why do you do this…?” Marco asked him, still wiping away his tears from a few minutes ago.\n“Don’t you ever ask that to yourself…?” \n“Kailangan ‘tong gawin, Marco…” Sir told him nonchalantly.\n“Kung sasabihin ko sa Ingles,”\n\n\n“It’s not my job to ask. It’s my job to do my job.”\n\n\nMarco looked up at Sir, anger building up inside him. He almost let it all out at that moment, but he held off at the last second. He quickly looked back on the floor and continued to wipe away his tears.\n“May kailangan akong asikasuhin, Marco. Pwede ka nang umalis,” Sir Ernest told him as he headed for the door.\n“No, wait!” Marco called out, remembering the direness of his situation.\n“It wasn’t me…I can prove it,” he told Sir.\n\n“Talaga…?” Sir asked in a condescending tone.\n“Give me 2 weeks,” Marco posited.\n“Bakit ko naman gagawin yun? Sino pa ba ang pwedeng nasa likod nito...?” Sir asked once more. Marco took a deep breath before finally explaining everything.\n“It’s this group of students called the Rising Phoenix…they’re behind this. They stole the perio papers…!” he explained.\n“I was hunting down one of their members…Jorge Ramiel of Grade 10. He got on the go-kart…I took the bike, chased after him…and we crashed.” Marco was fully prepared to be laughed at, but was confused to see a worried look on Sir’s face.\n“Sir…?” he asked.\n“Nandito pa sila…” Sir muttered to himself, which shocked Marco.\n\n“You *know* about this…?” Marco asked, bewildered.\n“Sa nakaraan, mga ilang taon pa, nakatanggap kami ng maraming anonymous na e-mail na hindi namin alam kung saan nagmula. 'The Rising Phoenix' ang tinawag nila sa sarili nila...at ang mga e-mails nila ay puro mga mungkahi para sa Pisay. Hindi namin sila pinansin at sinabihan namin silang dumaan sa tamang proseso. Mula noon, wala na kaming narinig mula sa kanila…hanggang ngayon,” Sir explained.\n“Why did you just ignore them…?”\n“Sinabi ko na, di sila dumaan sa tamang proseso.”\n“E-mailing seems like the most proper channel there is, don’t you think?”\n“Hindi mo ‘to desisyon. Kami ang gumagawa ng mga patakaran.”\n“Of course.”\n“ Baka tama ka. Bibigyan kita ng dalawang linggo bago ko simulan ang proseso ng pag-file. Sasabihan ko pa rin ang iyong magulang. Samantala, sisiguraduhin naming imbestigahan ito...at sana’y masugpo namin ito,” Sir told him.\n\n“Thank you Sir…” Marco said gratefully.\n“And please find them. I don’t know what they’ll do next…”\nMarco then walked up to the door and left the room. Just after Marco exited, Sir’s assistant came back into the room. She sat down at the dining table and began preparing herself a snack. \n“What happened?” she asked Sir, knowing about Marco’s situation and recognizing him as he walked out the door.\n“Sabi ko bibigyan ko sya ng Level 3, pero nagkaroon kami ng kasunduan na maghihintay ako ng dalawang linggo. At kung siya ay makapagbibigay ng sapat na ebidensya, papabayaan ko siya,” Sir explained.\n“You agreed to that?” she asked, confused. “...Why?”\n“Ma’am…” Sir told her, “…parang nagkamali tayo.”\n\n“How so?” she asked.\n“Naaalala mo ba ang mga anonymous e-mail na natanggap ng DO noon?”\n“Yeah…I heard about those.”\n“Kung sino man ang nagpadala nun, ay maaaring nasa likod ng bangaan ng go-kart…at ang pagkawala ng mga perio papers.”\n“I don’t see how that could happen, but we should investigate.”\n“Tama.”\n“They probably have a ringleader, considering they label themselves under a collective…”\n“Oo nga…trabahuhin natin ito. Magsimula tayo sa Jorge na ito…” Sir Ernest told her as he sat down at the DO computer. He pulled up the emails and began searching for clues about the Rising Phoenix.\n\n"

    "content": "The rest of the day was pure agony for Marco. All he could think about was the hell that was going to be raised when he got in the car with his mom, who insisted on picking him up that day. Nothing felt like it mattered anymore - he would walk around the hallways, staring down at the floor and not talking to anyone. His usual behavior of reciting as much as possible completely evaporated. Yet everyone just carried on. Pisay life just kept going for everyone else but him. Further souring his mood was the fact that Ma’am Lareigh, Marco’s Math teacher, had told him to meet with her at the Math Unit after her class after recently flunking a Math quiz. After Math period came and went, he begrudgingly made his way there, dreading what would be said to him.\n\nWhen he opened the door, he saw Ma’am Lareigh waiting for him on the table to the right, failed quiz in hand. He slowly made his way over to the empty chair across her and looked back down, making sure to hide his inner turmoil. \n“Marco…” Ma’am said, “Alam mo na tinawag kita dito kasi bagsak ka sa quiz.” Marco nodded slowly, bracing himself for whatever she had to say next.\n“Dapat sana ipapakita ko ang bawat mali mo. Pero mukhang hindi mahalaga ‘yun ngayon. Sa tingin ko, may iba kang problema.”\nMarco lifted his head slightly and looked at her, surprised at what she said.\n“Alam kong alam mo ang lahat ng aralin...pero napansin ko na parang nagbago ka. Mas nanahimik ka, mas mahiyain. Kung may problema ka, pwede mo namang sabihin sa akin, ok? Ano bang nangyayari sa iyo?” she asked.\n\nMarco stayed silent for a few seconds, going back to staring at the floor. He wasn’t prepared for her to ask that question. After a while, he decided to speak up.\n“I feel like I don’t belong here anymore…” he told her.\n“Everytime I try to do the right thing, I end up hurting everyone around me…now look at me. I’m an outcast. I can’t walk past the hallways anymore without someone staring at *me* - the guy who fell through the 3F Audi and crashed that go-kart, even though it’s not true…” he explained further.\n“And now I’m here…with a potential Level 3 on my hands, and…my mom hates me. All I am now is a burden…to everyone around me.”\nMa’am Lareigh stayed silent as she listened to Marco’s concerns. She made sure to listen to what he had to say, using it to put together the right words for him.\n\n“Hindi ka pabigat, Marco…” she told him.\n“Kahit andyan ka lang, pinapasigla mo na ang klase ko. Pag nagtatanong ka, mas lumilinaw ang pagtuturo ko sa mga kamag-aral mo. Mas maganda ang klase ko kapag kasama ka,” she said encouragingly.\n“Mukhang mahirap, pero alam ko na kaya mo ‘to. Hindi ‘to katapusan ng mundo. Napakatalino mo, at alam kong pipiliin mo kung ano ang tama. It’s in your nature,” she said.\n“Eto yung quiz mo…” she told him as she handed him his paper back.\n“May mga concepts dito na lalabas sa susunod na quiz, kaya balikan mo ‘to, ha? Next week ang Quiz 3. Tandaan mo lang…”\n\n\n“...kailangan mo lang subukan ulit.”\nWith that, Ma’am Lareigh sent Marco on his way.\n\n\t\nAfter managing to avoid Brianna, Glenn, and Prairie during lunch by eating somewhere out of the way, Marco endured his afternoon STEM classes and finally reached the end of the day. He immediately went to the drop-off, and after a few minutes, his mom’s car showed up. He couldn’t run from it anymore. He walked up to the backseat door, opened it, and sat down. Right after, his mom drove straight to Gate 3 and out of the campus.\n\n“Son…” she told him, “…the Discipline Office called me. I know what you did.” Those words sent chills down Marco’s spine. He knew he was in a world of trouble.\n“Mama, I’m sorry - ”\n“How could you DO THIS TO US?!” Marco’s mom yelled out, startling him.\n“A Level 3 offense? What were you thinking?! What are you going to do now?” she asked furiously, to which Marco could only stay silent.\n“How are you going to get into a good university? How will you get a good job? How are you going to find a wife - “\n“I don’t know, okay?!” Marco blurted out in frustration.\n\n“I put a roof over your head…I give you food, an education…the least you can do is be a good SON!” she shouted while gripping the steering wheel harder than normal.\n“I try, Mama!” Marco replied in kind.\n“I try so hard, but it’s never enough for you!”\n“Then BE ENOUGH! How hard is it to do what I tell you to, to stay out of trouble? What now?!” Marco’s mom asked once again. Marco couldn’t form the words in his mind - he could feel his mind collapsing right then and there.\n“I…I - “ he stuttered.\n“And what if you get a Level 4, huh?! My God, can’t you just think for one SECOND??” she asked before grumbling to herself.\n\n“If I get kicked out, there are other high schools. Pisay isn’t the end all be all - “ Marco replied before his mom interrupted him again.\n“No. You want to drop out? Might as well drop dead! This was your father’s dream…your family’s dream! How will you be a doctor now?!”\n“For the last time Mama, I want to be a physicist!” Marco yelled out to her.\n“For what? So you can die poor? Everyone in your family is a doctor…that’s where the money is!” she explained as she furiously waved her right hand around.\n\n“…what about cousin Tato?” he asked.\n“We don’t talk about him…he’s a failure. I will not let you end up like him,” she told him, which finally triggered the waterworks. Marco could feel the tears welling up in his eyes, for the thought of his mom deeming him a failure was too much for him to handle.\n“...I want to be a physicist…” he said through teary eyes.\n“...let me follow my dreams!”\n“Your priorities are ALL WRONG!” she screamed once more.\n“I’m trying to set up a bright future for you, son! Can’t you just cooperate with me?! You know, I just don’t understand what goes on in that head of yours!”\n“Well, I don’t understand what goes on in yours!” Marco retorted. His mom let out a sigh of indignation.\n“I can’t understand you, son. I really can’t…” she said, finally calming down somewhat.\n\nAfter she said that, the car went silent except from the quiet sobbing of Marco in the backseat. His mom had run out of both physical and mental energy to yell at him further. 15 more minutes passed before they exchanged another word. That was when Marco decided to ask his mom a question.\n\t\n“Mama…do you still love me…?” Marco asked her, voice still shaky from all the crying. His mom was taken aback by this.\n“What? Of course I do…” she said concerningly.\n“...why would you think otherwise?” \nTo this, Marco remained silent.\n\nThey both stayed silent once more for the rest of the trip. When Marco saw his house approaching from the distance, he couldn’t wait to just get out and go to sleep. Soon, their car pulled up to the driveway and Marco’s mom stopped the engine. They both got out at the same time, but Marco made his way to the door faster. He quickly made his way to his room and flopped onto the bed, burying his face deep in his pillow.\n\n“I’m sorry…” he muttered to himself, over and over and over.\n\n"

    "content": "The next day, Marco came to school completely despondent. He had cried himself to sleep the previous night and was clinging on to his last bit of hope. At lunch, he decided to buy some tonkatsu from Ajisakki and eat it by himself at one of the gazebos. He went to one that was moderately far away and placed his food down. Then, he slowly took a bite. It just didn’t feel the same anymore. Normally he would’ve enjoyed it, but all he could think about was everything that happened to him. At that moment, he heard footsteps approaching - it was Brianna.\n\n\t“Marco…?” she called out to him, but he didn’t acknowledge her presence. She quickly sat down beside him.\n\t“I wanted to talk to you yesterday, but I couldn’t find you…I just want to make sure you’re alright.”\n\t“Look at me, Brianna…” he told her.\n\t“...do I look alright to you?” he asked, staring at her with a deadpan expression.\n\t“Dapat nahulaan ko.”\n\t“I still have to find them…” Marco told her.\n\t“Ramone…they’re the key to this whole thing.”\n\n\t“Ayaw mo parin tigilan ‘to…?” Brianna asked, confused as anyone.\n\t“I have to keep going, Bri. Because if I don’t…then nobody will.”\n\t“Look at you. You’re a shell. It would be best to step away for a while, let me guide Glenn and Prairie…”\n\t“NO!” he shouted back.\n\t“If I step back now, all of this would’ve been for nothing! All I could think about last night was what would’ve happened if I’d done things differently. I never should’ve gotten on that bike…” Marco explained as he turned away from Brianna. \n\t“I have to bring them to justice. Not just for Pisay’s sake. But for mine too.”\n\t\nShe sighed, realizing that he was still determined as ever to take down the Rising Phoenix. \n“If you’re really still going to do this, if you’re still going to intercept the meeting tomorrow…then I just want you to…be careful,” she told him. \n“Try to keep it in one place this time, alright?”\n“I’ll try,” he reassured her.\n“Maybe you should bring me along, just in case,” she suggested.\n“No. I don’t want anyone else getting hurt again…” Marco told her, remembering how Octane shoved her hard just two days ago.\n“...I chose to do this. It should be me.”\n\n“So what’s your plan for tomorrow…?” Brianna asked Marco.\n“The deal’s happening at 2, so I’ll commute to Pisay and get there around 12. Hopefully Ramone won’t show up before then.”\n“But how will you get in? It’s Saturday tomorrow, the guards will stop you…”\n“I know some Grade 11s having SIP on-campus tomorrow. I look a lot like one of them if I take off my glasses, that’s how I’m getting in,” he explained.\n“It’s a miracle your glasses haven’t broken yet…” Brianna remarked, to which Marco let out a light chuckle. Silence followed afterwards.\n“This ends tomorrow. After that, I’ll be…free,” he said.\n\n“One last thing…” Brianna added,\n“Glenn told me to give this to you if I found you,” she explained, handing him a small pocket-sized recording device he could use to record whatever happened tomorrow. Marco gave her a nod of approval and put it in his pocket.\n“I hope you know what you’re doing…” Brianna told him apprehensively.\n“Anyway, I’ll give you some space. I think you need it,” she said as she got up and stepped away from the gazebo.\n“I wish you luck,” she told him before leaving.\nAfter seeing her go back to the BLOB, Marco returned to eating his tonkatsu - one slow, crunchy, miserable bite after the other.\n\nCome dismissal time, Marco was once again down in the dumps. He looked for somewhere to sit in the BLOB, ASTB, and FLOB, but all of the seats were taken. With that, he decided to go to the grandstand for the first time in a while. Right before he was about to exit the FLOB, it started to rain, so he took out his trusty umbrella from his bag and opened it. He then started his trek to the grandstand, looking down the whole time. As the rain poured, thunder could be heard and the impact of the raindrops on his umbrella grew louder and louder. As he walked over the field, he started stepping into mud puddles. In a fit of anger, he stomped on one of them, which ended up getting a little mud on his face, further upsetting him. He knew he was at the grandstand when the noises on his umbrella suddenly stopped.\n\n“What are you doing here…?” a familiar voice asked. Marco looked up and saw Darren sitting at the top part of the grandstand with sports gear on.\n“How do you always show up when I least expect it…?” he asked Darren.\n“I dunno…fate of the universe?” he replied as he chuckled to himself. He took another look at Marco and saw that he was clearly upset, just like the time they talked in the Kala Lane. \n“Wanna sit beside me…?” he asked as he patted the empty space beside him. Marco let out a sigh and decided to make his way there. He shook off all the rainwater from his umbrella, closed it, and sat down next to Darren. \n“I’m sorry, Marco…” Darren told him.\n“When that guy came in with the go-kart and you chased after him, I could tell it was something really important to you…and when I gave my testimony, I just…screwed it all up,” he told him.\n\n“No, Darren…don’t say sorry. If anything, I should be the one saying sorry…” Marco replied. \n“Why so…?” Darren asked honestly. Marco couldn’t take it anymore and let it all out once again.\n“I got a Level 3 offense yesterday, possibly Level 4…and my mom…she’s…not happy,” Marco explained fumblingly. \n“I’m nothing but a FAILURE…!” Marco said as he started to cry. Darren didn’t know what to do, so he patted him on the back as Marco cried into his palms.\n“I just feel so lost…and alone…” he told Darren.\n“Even if all of this didn’t happen, I don’t know what I’m doing…I’m not smart enough to be a physicist, let alone a doctor…and everything else just seems like a bad option…! I don’t know what I’m doing…I don’t know…” Marco said as he continued to cry.\n\n\n“...I’m never going to be enough.”\n\n\nDarren stared off into the rainy landscape, contemplating what he should say to Marco. Soon, Marco began to cry on his shoulder, which Darren let happen. After a while, Darren decided he needed to say something.\n“You know…” he told Marco,\n“You don’t have to be alone…I’ll always be here for you.” Marco, still sobbing, said his thanks to him for that. \n“To be honest…I don’t know what I’m doing with my life either,” he reassured him.\n“Nothing’s really hooked me at the moment. I wish we weren’t told so young to pick what we’ll do for the rest of our lives, but that’s the world we live in. And deep down…I think we’ll both find what you love.”\n“...maybe you’ve already found yours.”\n\n“Why is the world so unfair…?” Marco asked Darren. \n“Why can’t we all just be kind to each other…how much better would the world be if we all just did that…?”\n“Why is it so hard to do the right thing…it feels like everyone’s out to get you, you know? My whole life, I’ve felt like…a puppet…on strings. Never allowed to be who *I* want to be…do what *I* want to do…” he continued, still in tears.\n“...that’s why I’ve been so…determined. To finally make a difference…to break out of this mold I’ve been forced into, you know?”\nDarren nodded in agreement, understanding where he was coming from.\n“Everything will be okay as long as we do the right thing,” Darren told him.\n“That’s what I like to believe. Good will always prevail over evil. That kind of thing.”\n\n“I should tell you…” Marco said.\n“...I’ve been keeping it a secret from you for too long.”\n“What secret…?” Darren asked. Marco slowed down his crying and began to explain.\n“These past few months…I’ve been hunting down this organization in Pisay called the Rising Phoenix. They’ve been in the shadows, planning something dangerous…and I’ve been trying to stop them,” he explained.\n“That guy you saw on the go-kart…he was one of our leads. I tried to chase him…and…I failed.”\nDarren processed what he heard for a bit, not believing it at first, but quickly coming to the conclusion that Marco was telling the truth.\n“...I guess that explains it,” Darren said.\n\n“I don’t tell people this because they’ll think I’m crazy…” Marco explained.\n“And between all the things people have heard about me…telling them won’t help in the slightest. And the Rising Phoenix could be anyone…I can’t risk it.”\n“So you trust me…?” \n“Of course I trust you, Darren,” he told him.\n“I’m glad you got the courage to tell me,” he replied.\n“Thank you for being here for me…” he told Darren.\n“I’m glad to be.”\n\nSuddenly, Marco gave Darren a big hug, which startled him greatly. But after a few seconds of being hugged by Marco, his heart felt full. He gladly hugged him back, and the pair stayed that way for a few more seconds. Finally, they got out of the hug and looked at each other happily. Marco checked the time on his phone and quickly realized he was about to miss the bus.\n“Sorry, I’ve got to go…” Marco told Darren.\n“I’m going to miss my bus if I don’t leave soon.”\n“That’s alright. At least I made you feel better, right?”\n“Yeah…you did.”\n“And also, one more thing…” Darren said to Marco,\n“...you shouldn’t walk in the middle of the field while it’s raining. They’re in the middle of replacing the lightning rod, so yeah.”\n“Alright, I’ll be more careful next time,” Marco assured him.\n\nMarco slowly got up and left the grandstand, waving goodbye to Darren. He now felt optimistic about what would happen the next day.\n\n"

    "title": "MUTUALISTIC SYMBIOSIS",
    "content": "*Ring, ring!*\n*Ring, ring!*\n*Ring -*\n\n\tMarco quickly turned off his alarm and sat upright. Today was the day - the day of the meeting. It was 10:30AM, and his mom had just gone to a conference a few hours before. He slowly got up and walked to the bathroom to take a shower. After he finished cleaning himself, he stepped out of the shower and dried himself off. He looked at the mirror and only then realized how different he looked. His eyebags had grown larger and his face wore an expression of exhaustion, despite him getting a full 10 hours of sleep. He brushed it off and quickly put on his uniform, remembering to bring the recording device Brianna gave him in his pocket before heading out the door.\n\n\tHe walked for a few minutes over to the nearest busy road to his house to wait for a jeepney. After waiting for some time, a jeepney headed to where he wanted to go finally approached him, and he got on as fast as he could. He squeezed into the available space, and the jeepney took off. He took his exact payment from his other pocket and paid in the middle of the trip. Soon, he was near Pisay.\n\t“Para po!” he called out as the jeepney approached PCMC. He got off the jeep, walking the rest of the way to Pisay.\n\nAfter getting past the guard, he went around the Admin Building and made his way to the 4F Audi. As he got closer and closer to the top, his heart started to beat faster. If Ramone was already there, it could mean disaster. As he finished climbing up the final flight of stairs, he stopped for a moment and took a breather. There’s nothing to worry about, he assured himself. He took a right, opting to take the front entrance to the 4F Audi in case the back entrance was locked. As he approached the door, he took out his recording device and turned it on. This was the point of no return. Slowly, he twisted the knob and opened the door.\n\nUpon entering, he noticed how dark the room was, save for some light peeking out from the gaps in the blinds. The place was a mess, still uncleaned from a previous event, with a few tables and chairs strewn about. Every step he made echoed throughout the hauntingly empty space. He looked around and found nothing - but the big divider in the middle of the 4F Audi was still closed, which he knew he had to look behind. He stepped towards it and slowly pried it open. On the other side, he saw an unexpected sight. There were two chairs with desks beside them, each having a plastic cup of water on top. The furthest chair was that red, dusty office chair he’d seen a few times before, which was turned the opposite direction. A set of exposed windows shone the sky’s melancholic white light into the room.\n\n“Hello…?” he called out, walking closer to it.\n“Is someone there?” he asked, stepping even closer.\nThe chair slowly turned around, revealing who was sitting on it - it was Obsidian, carrying a long, wooden cane with a black rubber handle and metal tip. Before Marco could turn around and run, the divider behind him quickly slammed shut. He frantically turned around and saw two students wearing red bird masks holding the handle of one side of the divider each. They were wearing metal plates on them - one on his forearms, and one on his shins. He was trapped.\n“It’s nice to see you again, Marco,” Obsidian told him.\n“Have a seat,” he said as he pointed at the chair opposite him with his cane.\n\n“You’ve got some nerve showing your face to me again…!” Marco said aggressively as he ran up to Obsidian, ready to deck him in the face. Before his fist made contact however, Obsidian swiftly blocked it with his palm. He then started crushing Marco’s hand with his own, piling on as much pressure as he could.\n“Ow, ow, ow, ow…!” Marco yelled out as he started to feel the pain.\n“Stop, please…let go, I’m sorry!” he begged Obsidian.\nFinally, Obsidian let go of his fist. Marco collapsed to the floor and panted heavily.\n“...now can we talk…?” Obsidian asked.\n“Never,” Marco replied angrily.\n\n“I see how it is. Come over,” Obsidian said as he motioned towards the two Rising Phoenix members at the back of the room, in addition to another in the corner that Marco failed to spot before. It was a girl holding a long taser with two metal prongs and held together with duct tape. While they all walked towards Marco, she turned it on, releasing a spark of electricity. As they got closer, Marco realized his error.\n“Alright, stop! Let’s talk!” he told Obsidian, which prompted him to make the others stand down.\nMarco reluctantly sat down in the chair opposite to Obsidian while he sat in his. \n“Care for a drink?” Obsidian asked as he went for his cup of water. Marco remained motionless, declining the offer.\n“What, you think we’re going to poison you? We’re not monsters, you know,” Obsidian remarked as he took a sip from his cup. After a few seconds, he put it down and looked back at Marco.\n\n“Why are you being so nice to me…?” Marco asked in a confused tone.\n“I realized that the last two times we met, I tried to use fear to earn your respect. But now I realize that…that may not be the right way,” Obsidian explained.\n“I want you to see us for who we truly are, Marco - good people who’ve been wronged by the system…and because of that, sometimes we have to do the wrong things for the right reasons.”\n“So that’s how you justify assault, theft, fraud, destruction of property…all because you want petty revenge?” Marco asked angrily.\n“Honestly, what you guys have done *is* really impressive. I mean, you’ve hacked systems effortlessly, created those smoke grenade things…but instead of doing something good with it, you waste it on this. Why…?!”\n“You call it petty revenge or a waste, but you don’t know what we’ve been through…what *I’ve* been through,” Obsidian replied.\n\nObsidian slowly got off his chair and walked to the window with his cane in hand. The metallic tip of the cane produced a loud clacking sound as it hit the tiles of the floor. He stopped in front of it and gazed at the landscape before him, showering him with white light.\n“I wasn’t born into an easy life, Marco,” he began.\n“I have 5 siblings…and sometimes, we struggled to make ends meet. Still, we all managed to perform well academically and get into good schools. And when I took the NCE, no one expected me to pass,” Obsidian explained.\n“But one day, I learned that I got in. We were all so happy…and for the first time, I was celebrated…I was important. I signed the contract and off I went to Pisay. But as time went on, I quickly realized my success was a fluke. I was doing abysmally both academically and socially. The only friend I managed to make was this one girl…her name was Carmen. She was the best.”\n\n“We would do *everything* together…we connected over our growing hatred of Pisay. We were misfits, out of place - outsiders. Not smart enough to get good grades…not affable enough to be popular. She was deteriorating as much as I was…and I found a quantum of solace in that - and by extension, her. That was until at the end of Grade 8. Her grades had dropped too low, and her parents had enough. They withdrew her from Pisay. I was supposed to tell her my true feelings the day she left. After that, she cut me off out of pure shame…and I never saw or talked to her again. I was in pieces. Every night, I would clutch my pillow tight, begging for her to come back. She was all I had…” Obsidian recounted somberly.\n\n“I couldn’t hold it in anymore. Sir Ernest was my adviser back then, so I told him about it. And when I did…he just told me to get over it. And when I told my family, they said the same thing. They dismissed it as just puppy love…something a scholar like me had no business wasting time on. But when my grades continued to fall, *that’s* when they paid attention. Just like that, I was a shame to my family - and a headache to Sir Ernest. That’s when I realized that…no one cared about me. I was nothing more than a cog in the machine…a pawn in someone else’s game. I’ve tried filling the gap she left behind, but it’s not the same. It never will be. Something snapped in me since then…and now, here I am,” Obsidian concluded.\n\nMarco looked at Obsidian with shock and sadness. He had no idea that’s what he went through.\n“I’m…sorry that happened to you,” Marco told him.\n“...but for other people, Pisay is where their dreams came true. Where they…learned the skills they needed to benefit the world. And if you bring it down, not only are you cheating hundreds out of a job…but thousands out of a future,” Marco explained sorrowfully.\n\n“It doesn’t matter,” Obsidian rebutted.\n“There are too many broken people just like me…and there will be more if Pisay continues to exist. I don’t like what I have to do, Marco. But I do it anyway.”\n“But you don’t have to…! Can’t you see?” Marco asked him.\n“Pisay is broken, Marco. You’re the one who can’t see what’s right in front of you!” Obsidian argued as he stepped away from the window to look at him.\n“I know you know I’m right,” Obsidian continued.\n“How’s your research project going, Marco?”\n“Why do you ask…?”\n“Just…tell me.”\n“Fine. It’s an utter disaster. Nothing’s going well…”\n“...and there’s my point.”\n\n“What exactly are you trying to prove here?” Marco asked angrily.\n“Let me recall…issues procuring electromagnetic coils…your research adviser going out of the country…snooze-inducing lectures…mountains of tedious paperwork. Doesn’t it all seem so…pointless? Doing all of that just to be a drop in the ocean that is science today?” Obsidian asked, to which Marco remained speechless.\n“Everyone in this school agrees that Research is a thorn in their side, *everyone*. For a place designed to create the next generation of Filipino scientists, we should be mortified that this is happening…! But nothing has changed. It’s been this way for years. If they cared, they would’ve listened. But they don’t. Because they don’t care about us. Now do you see my point?” Obsidian explained passionately.\n\n“Look, I agree, Research could use some improvement…” Marco told him.\n“...but you can’t judge the entirety of Pisay from just that! They do care! What about all the other subjects? And you’re not even correct, they are taking steps to change it!” Marco retorted.\n“...not fast enough,” Obsidian replied.\n“What do you expect?! You want to dive headfirst into changes you don’t know will work or not, you are *just* as bad as them!”\n“I’m fighting for us. That includes you! So don’t you *dare* say that!”\n“You want us to go to the other end of the spectrum…complete recklessness. Look past your anger and think for a second…!” Marco pleaded.\n“Amazing…you’re still on their side when all they’ve done is hurt you.”\n\n“This is how it must be, Marco,” Obsidian continued.\n“This is too important…and I’m too far in to stop.”\n\tMarco sighed deeply. Obsidian was too entrenched in his ways, he thought. A moment of silence permeated the air as the two dwelled on what they said.\n\t“What are you planning, anyway? Your guy mentioned a program,” he asked him.\n\t“S.P.E.C.T.R.E.,” Obsidian replied.\n\t“Its name is S.P.E.C.T.R.E. And it will free us all.”\n“And the drive…?” Marco asked further.\n“That drive is the only way to stop S.P.E.C.T.R.E. from executing. We want it in the right hands…ours.”\n\n“Isn’t it against your best interest to tell me this…?”\n“No…no it isn’t. While I’ve enjoyed our little back-and-forth, that’s not what I came here for,” Obsidian said as he sat back down in his chair.\n“I came here to make another deal with you. And this is my last,” he explained.\n“Nope, nope. Last time we talked about a deal, I ended up in the hospital,” Marco told him.\n“If you don’t run this time, you won’t,” Obsidian replied. Marco looked back and saw the three Rising Phoenix members standing there menacingly. He quickly realized it was best to listen to what he had to say.\n“If you accept this deal, I can get you your old life back,” Obsidian explained.\n“You can say yes, you can say no. No one will know,” he said as he glanced at Marco’s pocket and back at him. Noticing this, Marco frantically reached into his pocket and pulled out the recording device, only to find it playing garbled noise back at him. Slowly, a distorted voice emerged from the noise and whispered the chilling words to Marco:\n“We’re *everywhere*.”\n\nTerrified, Marco slowly put the device back in his pocket and paid full attention to whatever Obsidian had to say.\n“I know you’ve heard of Ramone already. They were a brilliant member. One of our best at hacking, second only to Overclock. When it was just the four of us, we used to play Blackjack together, and they’d always jump on the opportunity to show off their card-throwing skills. But those days are…long gone.”\n“Ever since Ramone went off the grid, we’ve combed through every clue we could find…but we got nothing. Every single digital record has been altered with false information, and we haven’t been able to get our hands on anything physical…” he explained further.\n“...and that’s where you come in.”\n“For months, we’ve known about the existence of a secret room in Pisay. Under the Admin Building is the Records Room - a place where they’ve dumped every physical record from students as far back as Batch 1973,” he explained.\n“We’ve never been able to find a way in…we believe that somewhere there, their current address is noted down. If you find them, get that drive, and give it back to us - we can give you your old life back.”\n\n“I thought Ramone was coming here later,” Marco asked.\n“They heard about what happened last Wednesday. Probably got spooked. Flaked at the last second,” Obsidian told him.\n“And how will I get my old life back, exactly…?”\n“We’ll frame one of our own. Say they blackmailed you into doing these things. We have plenty of people with nothing to lose here…it won’t be difficult at all. And if you don’t believe me…we’ve had this key we don’t know the lock to. It might be useful to you,” he told Marco as he tossed him a rusty key that looked older than the both of them. Marco then stuffed it deep in the pocket opposite his recording device.\n“So…what’s it going to be, Marco?”\n\nEntering a staredown with Obsidian, Marco thought carefully about what he would say next, considering there were three people behind him that were ready to pounce. As he continued to think, he felt time almost slow down as Obsidian leaned forward, making his growing impatience apparent. He sighed deeply and decided to say something he never would’ve a month ago:\n\n“I’ll do it.”\n\n Marco was still against the Rising Phoenix, but he felt like saying this would spare him another beating. Obsidian laid back on the chair and took a deep breath.\n“Thank you for cooperating, Marco…” Obsidian told him, seemingly surprised by his decision. \n“Voltage, Celsius, Fahrenheit…” he said as he motioned to the three Rising Phoenix members behind Marco,\n“Get him.”\nVoltage quickly turned on her taser, and all three of them dashed towards Marco.\n\n"

    "content": "Marco rapidly got up from his chair and shoved it towards Celsius and Fahrenheit as hard as he could, knocking them both back a few feet. Voltage strafed past the chair and took a swing at Marco with her taser - missing him by an inch. He kicked the table towards her, which she managed to partially catch. Before he kicked it, he took the cup of water off the table - he poured its contents on the floor in front of Celsius and Fahrenheit, which caused the two to slip. \n\nVoltage took another couple of swings, barely missing Marco both times. Fahrenheit got up and kicked Marco with the metal plate on his shin, sending him falling back on the red office chair Obsidian sat on previously. He spun a few times before holding out his foot and stopping his momentum with the blue cubicle wall at the back of the 4F Audi. He swiftly kicked as hard as he could, which sent him flying past the three of them. Voltage tried to poke him with her taser, but he was going too fast. Celsius, however, managed to get a good hit on Marco’s face with his forearm plates.\n\nThis caused Marco to lean back in pain, and combined with rolling over the water he previously spilled, the office chair fell backwards. Marco hurriedly rolled off the dry side of the chair and ran through the divider as fast as he could. Voltage, Celsius, and Fahrenheit followed him, with Voltage staying slightly behind to recalibrate her taser. Marco turned back and saw Celsius and Fahrenheit coming straight for him from the left and the right. He kicked Fahrenheit in the chest and blocked Celsius from hitting him in the face again. He shoved him away just as Fahrenheit got up, who took a hard swing at Marco’s shins, which Marco got out of the way of in time.\n\nFahrenheit aimed for Marco’s legs again, hitting his knee and making it buckle. This made Marco kneel to the floor right as Celsius tried to hit him in the face again. Marco used the time on his knees to elbow Celsius in the side and backwards-headbutt Fahrenheit in the stomach. They both fell backwards before quickly rushing Marco once more, with Voltage finally joining back in. Marco lifted his leg before Fahrenheit could hit it, while Voltage tried to tase him again. He caught it by the non-electric rod part and dragged it towards Celsius, but he blocked it with his arm plates. Celsius pushed the taser back, but in the process swung it at Fahrenheit, electrocuting his hand. At this point, Marco was backed up into a long table that was left out in the open.\n\nCelsius quickly grabbed Marco’s left hand with both of his, with Fahrenheit following suit and grabbing Marco’s right hand with all his strength. They pinned him down on the table while Fahrenheit hit him hard on the shins, causing him to fall on it. Voltage held the taser in front of her face with glee before poking Marco with it, electrocuting him for several agonizing seconds.\n“AHHHH…!!” he yelled out as he writhed in pain.\n\nVoltage took out the taser while Celsius and Fahrenheit continued to pin him down on the table. As she tried to tase him again, Marco jerked to the right as hard as he could, making the taser miss him by centimeters. Marco kicked himself upwards with his right foot and used the other to kick Voltage backwards. Fahrenheit’s electrocuted hand got to him and he let go of Marco’s right hand, which he used to deck Celsius in the face. Marco kicked Fahrenheit away and fell forwards to the ground, attempting to pick up the taser that Voltage dropped just then. They grabbed at it at the same time and tugged as hard as they could, but Voltage started to get the upper hand. But suddenly, they all heard the door burst open.\n\nIt was Brianna. She ran towards Voltage and tackled her to the ground while Celsius and Fahrenheit stared in bewilderment. Marco felt two emotions at once - happy that Brianna saved him, and incredibly surprised that she was even there in the first place. Brianna quickly got off Voltage and looked at Marco with a furious expression.\n“Brianna…?!” Marco yelled out.\nBefore she could respond, she made her way through the divider, with Celsius and Fahrenheit targeting her instead. The divider slammed shut as Voltage slowly got back up, staring at Marco with pure anger behind her eyes. \n\nMarco got back up on his feet, still recovering from being tased a few seconds ago. It was now just them - one on one. Voltage ran towards Marco and held out her taser, which Marco got out of the way of just in time. As she whizzed right by him, he noticed that the end of the taser was much brighter than before. Voltage turned back around and took a swing, which Marco dodged by bending over backwards harder than he’d ever done his whole life. As her swing missed, Marco ran over to the table, with Voltage running right behind him. As he ran, he heard the divider slam, indicating that Brianna was still fighting Celsius and Fahrenheit on the other side. He rolled over the table and fell behind it, which caught Voltage off-guard. She knelt down and tried to tase him under the table, only to find him palms out, ready to grab her taser once more.\n\nHe caught it and pulled as hard as he could, with Voltage giving equal resistance. As they tugged, Marco stood up, which Voltage also did. He quickly freed his right hand and used it to push the table backwards, catching Voltage off-guard once more. As he pushed, the table began to fall over, all while they were still pulling on the taser. Soon, the table’s center of mass had gone too far and it fell onto the floor. With both of them still holding on, the taser remained under the table - and when it fell, it got crushed in half. Voltage fell backwards, holding one half of the broken taser in her hand. Marco tossed his broken half at Voltage before dusting his hands off, with her clutching the broken pieces angrily. She opened the divider and signaled for Celsius and Fahrenheit to retreat with her, and all three escaped the 4F Audi through the back door. The fight was finally over.\n\nMarco leaned on the tipped table and panted heavily, trying to catch his breath. Looking up, he saw the divider open and Brianna crawl on the floor with a red mark on her face. She gripped the divider edge, using it to get back up on her feet.\n“What are you doing here…?” Marco asked her before slumping over the table.\n“I got worried…” she explained as she managed to stand up fully.\n“I had a feeling that you’d be in trouble again…so I made my way here to back you up. Na-late ako, pasensya na…”\n“You…didn’t have to do that,” Marco told her.\n“But I was right. Look what you got yourself into!” Brianna said to him in a concerned tone.\n\n“You cannot keep doing this, Marco!” she told him sternly.\n“But I just learned a lot about them…and I got the key to their eventual defeat…literally,” Marco said as he pulled out the rusty key Obsidian gave him. Brianna looked at it curiously for a while, but got back to talking to Marco.\n“Marco…I think you’re getting obsessed,” Brianna explained.\n“Tigilan mo na ‘to, Marco.” \n“Bri, don’t you understand?!” Marco told her.\n“I’m finally getting somewhere again! If I find Ramone’s address, I’ll find the drive and end the Rising Phoenix! I have to keep going!”\nBrianna took a deep sigh.\n“You know what? Keep going. But don’t expect me to jump in the hole you dug for yourself,” she said as she walked towards the front door of the 4F Audi.\n\n“Wait…” Marco called out as he stood up.\n“I forgot to bring more money to commute back home. Do you have any…?” Marco asked her. Brianna sighed and reached into her wallet, giving Marco a crumpled up 100 peso bill.\n“Pay me back next week…” she said as she walked off, heading to Gate 1.\nMarco put the bill in his pocket and stared out the nearest window, contemplating what he would do next.\n\nWhatever this S.P.E.C.T.R.E. program was, he was now on the path to putting a stop to it, and by extension, the Rising Phoenix. \n\nAll he had to do now was find Ramone.\n\n"

    "content": "“Ramone Alekhine T. Villanueva…” Marco muttered to himself on the jeep on the way home. \n“...find Ramone Villanueva.”\n“Nung sinasabi mo…” a commuter sitting nearby told him.\n“Sorry…” Marco told them as he curled up slightly, vowing to stay silent for the rest of the trip. As he began to get close to home, he glanced at his watch - it read 1:37PM. He breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that his mom would return from her conference much later than that. After a few minutes, he got off the jeep and walked back home. He opened the door, went back to his room, and flopped onto his bed - leaving behind no evidence of his unauthorized departure.\n\nAt that point, all of his energy had been drained from commuting and fighting in the 4th Floor Audi. He laid down on his pillow and dozed off for a few hours. When he woke up, it was 6PM. He was briefly in that daze one gets after waking up from a good nap. Soon, Marco remembered that Glenn and Prairie still didn’t know about what happened. \n“I can’t drag them into this too…” he thought to himself before quickly realizing that he still needed their help to break into the archive room.\n\nHe pulled out his laptop and started a call on their Dexterous Detectives group DM on Discord. He soon realized that Brianna was still in the DM and he was ringing her too. Disheartened, Marco clicked the button to stop ringing her and waited for the other two to show up.\n\nAfter a short while, Prairie joined the call, excited for what Marco potentially accomplished.\n“Marco! Anong nangyari? Nakuha mo ba yung drive?” she asked him.\n“Uh…not exactly. Let’s just wait for Glenn,” Marco replied.\nThey waited there for a few minutes before Glenn finally joined the call.\n“Hey, Glenn!” Marco told him.\n“...what took you so long…?”\n“Oh…I had to mentally prepare myself to join this call first,” Glenn explained, which slightly annoyed Marco.\n“Ok…anyway, I went to their meeting today, and it...didn’t really go to plan.”\n\nMarco proceeded to detail everything that happened that day, from him getting tricked into dealing with Obsidian, to the mention of the S.P.E.C.T.R.E. program, to the revelation of the Records Room, the chaotic fight with Voltage, Fahrenheit, and Celsius, and finally to Brianna suddenly barging in to help him. As he explained this, Prairie’s expression grew more and more shocked while Glenn simply leaned towards the camera more. \n“Anyway, that was the gist of it…” Marco said at the end of it.\n“The important thing is, I got a key and a location,” he explained as he held up the rusty key he got from Obsidian to the camera. \n“Iyan yung susi...” Prairie muttered as she saw it for the first time.\n“Alam mo ba kung ano ang binubuksan niyan?” she asked Marco.\n“No…but from what it looks like, *this* is our way into the Records Room,” he replied as he continued to hold up the key.\n\n“Totoo nga na merong Records Room...” Prairie muttered.\n“What…?” Marco blurted out.\n“Matagal ko nang alam yan. Kung alam mo ang hinahanap mo, mapapansin mong nababanggit siya sa ilang mga dokumento ng paaralan,” Prairie explained as she adjusted her glasses.\n“At noong nakaraang taon, may nakita akong lumang floor plan na may sinamang silid na walang pangalan. Akala ko hindi lang nila natuloy gawin yung silid na iyon,” she explained further.\n\n“Do you still have that floor plan?” Marco asked excitedly.\n“Oo, na sa akin pa. Teka, hanapin ko sa kompyuter ko...”\nAfter a couple minutes of waiting, Prairie found the picture and sent it to their Discord DM. As Marco examined the photo, he quickly noticed the ripped part of the paper on top. Looking closer, he noticed two letters right at the edge of the rip that could barely be made out - one that looked like either an R or a K at the start, and one that looked like an M at the end.\n“Look at this…” Marco told Prairie as he pointed out the letters. \n“Batay sa laki ng mga titik at sa pagitan nila sa isa't isa, bagay nga yung 'Records Room' na pangalan diyan,” Prairie concluded.\n“Hindi ko napansin iyon, Marco. Salamat.”\n\n“So this is under the Admin Building, right?” Marco asked, to which Prairie nodded.\n“How deep down is it exactly…?” he continued.\n“Hindi ko alam... pero batay sa floor plan na 'to, mukhang tumutugma yung pinto ng Records Room sa bagong elevator shaft na pinapatayo nila...” Prairie remarked as she pulled up the 1st Floor Admin Building floor plan.\nMarco took a deep sigh, realizing what he was going to have to do. \n“I’m gonna have to scale down there, aren’t I…”\n“Oo, baka kailangan mong bumaba.”\nSuddenly, Glenn piped in after staying silent for a while.\n“Oh no. We are *not* doing this,” Glenn told the two of them.\n“Huh? Bakit hindi?”\n“So we’re going to break into this secret underground room that we don’t even know the looks of? Ang pangit ng planong 'to, hindi ako sasama diyan!”\nAll Marco could do was bury his face in his hands, as he could tell convincing Glenn would take a while. He simply didn’t have the energy or the mood to deal with him at that moment.\n“If you want someone’s help, get Brianna. I’m staying out of this one!” Glenn said, which worsened Marco’s mood even more.\n“GLENN, TUMAHIMIK KA NGA!” Prairie yelled out, which startled Marco.\n“Ang PANGIT ng ugali mo! Ikaw naman, lagi kang nanloloob ng mga server, pero kapag kami ang gustong mang-hack, biglang kang may problema sa amin. Wala tayong ibang paraan upang matigil ang RISING PHOENIX! Kung ayaw mong mawala ang Pisay, TUTULUNGAN MO KAMI...!” she shouted at Glenn.\nMarco and Glenn were both shocked. They’d never seen her flip off the handle like that before. Prairie stared angrily at the screen, panting, until Glenn finally spoke up.\n\n“Sige nga, tutulong ako...” Glenn uttered in a huff, realizing that Prairie was right - much to the relief of Marco.\n“Teka, nasaan nga pala si Brianna?” Prairie asked, which made Marco slightly more gloomy.\n“She doesn’t really wanna get involved right now…let’s just leave it at that,” he replied dejectedly. Glenn and Prairie sensed that this was a private matter and quickly moved on from the topic.\n“I’ve thought of some gadgets I could…’borrow’,” Glenn said in a concerning tone, “but I’m gonna have to take a look at them tomorrow night…my dad and I are going to shop for my prom outfit tomorrow morning.”\n“Right…” Marco replied, “...I forgot prom’s next week already.”\n“Pwede tayong sumalakay sa Miyerkules. Nasuspinde na ang mga klase, kani-kanina lang,” Prairie suggested.\n\n“Saka, Marco, suriin natin yung floor plan ng Records Room...” she added further.\n“...and I should tell you about the gadgets we’re gonna use,” Glenn continued.\n“Alright,” Marco told them both.\n\n\n“Tell me more.”\n\n"

    "content": "Wednesday arrived, and Marco went on campus along with Glenn and Prairie. All of them had come up with various excuses as to why they were there, but they all knew what they were really here for. Glenn handed the necessary equipment to Marco in a backpack and stayed in the library with Prairie. \n\t“Check, check…” Glenn said as he tested the earpieces he gave Marco to wear. Marco gave him a thumbs-up as he heard him loud and clear.\n\t“These should have a longer range, so losing connection shouldn’t be an issue. I’m gonna make sure all the cameras that could see you are frozen…good luck,” Glenn told Marco, who promptly took the backpack and waved goodbye to him and Prairie.\n\n\tMarco then strolled up to the elevator shaft in the Admin Building, his nerves starting to get to him. When he got there, he placed his bag down and talked to Prairie, who volunteered to be on the other end of communications.\n\t“Nasa harap ka ba ng elevator?” Prairie asked, to which Marco said yes.\n\t“Sige...kunin mo yung pryer,” she ordered, leading Marco to take out a large contraption designed to pry open metal doors.\n\t“Remember what we discussed…put it in the gap and twist the knob…!” Glenn instructed from afar. Marco followed his instructions and pried the elevator doors apart, exposing the deep, dark interior of the elevator shaft. Marco made sure to pry it open just enough for him to fit.\n\n\t“How deep is it…?” Prairie asked as Marco looked down through it.\n\t“Looks about 10 meters tall…?” he told her. Before she could give out an instruction, Marco put the pryer down and took out the other gadgets in the bag - a grapple and a belt. He fastened the belt on his waist and attached the grapple to the buckle quickly in case someone was approaching nearby.\n\t“OK, sinuot mo na ba yung belt at yung grapple?” Prairie asked, which Marco once again said yes to.\n\t“The other side of the grapple has a drill, right? Make sure you shove it into the wall as hard as you can…!” Glenn ordered as Marco looked over the edge of the doors. His hands shaked a bit as he looked for a spot to embed the drill, knowing how deep the shaft went. Finally, he found a good spot and shoved the drill in. Thankfully, it went in deep enough to be secure. Marco got up and took a deep breath - he was going to have to jump down.\n\n\t“Hingang malalim, Marco, mabilis lang 'to - ”\n\t“Just jump already!”\nHolding his breath, Marco jumped down the shaft. The grapple worked at slowing his fall, but he was still screaming on the inside. After what felt like forever, Marco’s butt hit the ground as he panted heavily. \n\t“Nasa baba ka na?”\n\t“Yeah…”\n\nMarco slowly got up and unbuckled the grapple, which made it zip back up to the top of the shaft. He dusted himself off and continued forth. He could see some light, and when he took a left, he saw an ominous sight.\n“Marco, anong nakikita mo?”\n“There’s a really old-looking door here…and a single lightbulb hanging over it.”\nMarco slowly walked up to it and examined the doorknob, noticing that it had a keyhole in it. He dug into his pocket, pulled out the rusty key, and carefully inserted it into the keyhole. It seemed to fit perfectly. He closed his eyes and twisted it to the right - he heard something click…and the door creaked open.\n\nElated, Marco slowly pushed the door open and looked inside. What he saw awed him - the Records Room was a gigantic, rectangular space with fluorescent lamps on the ceiling, complete with their distinct droning hum. Their light colored the room a nauseatingly bright blue, which reflected off the unfathomable number of filing cabinets. They stretched from floor to ceiling and covered nearly every square foot of the room, save for some walking space between them. \n\nThey were neatly arranged into rows in the middle of the room and covered all the walls on the sides. One could tell which filing cabinets belonged to the older batches, as they were discolored and slightly rusted, while the newer batches’ records were put in more recently bought filing cabinets. Strewn about were some boxes of records that hadn’t been sorted and a couple of ladders for reaching the higher cabinets.\n\n“Nasa loob ka na?”\n“Yup. This is it.”\n“Nakapasok na siya,” Prairie told Glenn, which led to them giving each other a light high-five.\n“Batay sa floor plan, mukhang yung mga dokumento ng mga naunang batch ay nilagay nila malapit sa pintuan,” Prairie informed Marco.\n“Yeah, I think I can tell…” Marco said as he saw the cabinets go from old to new as he looked down the aisle.\n“You know, if they’re still putting records here, how exactly do they get down here to put them…?” Marco asked as he took a right and walked down the hall created by the filing cabinets. Suddenly, he heard a door open on the other side of the room.\n\nMarco quickly ran to the end of the hall as quietly as possible and hid at the end of the last row of cabinets. \n“Someone’s here…” he whispered to Prairie, which terrified her.\n“What happened…?” Glenn asked, sensing something amiss.\nMarco then heard a set of footsteps get closer and closer to him. He held his breath as he heard the footsteps go from his left to his right. He then heard whoever this was pick up some boxes and put them on what Marco thought was most likely a trolley. Shortly after, he heard some filing cabinets open. Whoever this was seemed to be clearing out records for some reason unknown to him.\n\nAll the filing cabinets were labeled with the year of the batch records they contained. And when Marco looked down to the end of the hall, he saw the cabinet of the batch one year behind him - the one that would theoretically have Ramone’s file in it. Making sure not to make a sound, Marco brisk walked as fast as he could to the filing cabinet. Suddenly, he began hearing footsteps again, causing him to quickly hide behind the nearest row of filing cabinets.\n\nThe footsteps swiftly stopped however, but Marco’s heart continued to beat out of his chest. Carefully looking back beforehand, he continued walking to the filing cabinet with Ramone’s file as fast and as silently as possible. Every second felt like life or death as he was out in the open. Finally, he made it. The filing cabinet consisted of 8 separate cabinets, each of which contained the files sorted in alphabetical order. \n\n“V…Where’s V…” he frantically thought to himself before his eyes gravitated to the bottom-most right cabinet. He bent down and carefully slid it open, revealing a multitude of neatly organized folders labeled with each student’s first name initial followed by their surname. \n\nAs Marco carefully flipped through the folders, he heard the worst thing he could’ve at that moment. The footsteps started again - and they were getting closer.\n\nMarco flipped through the folders as fast as he could while still reading the surnames labeled on the tab, desperately trying to find the one that said Villanueva on it. The clack of the mystery person’s shoes on the tiled floor echoed through Marco’s head as he felt himself getting closer alphabetically to the Villanueva surname. The clacks grew louder…and louder…and louder. But then he found it - R. Villanueva. Problem was, there were two of them.\n\nIn a blind panic, Marco felt like he had to pick only one of them to take. But which one?\n\nHe could hear the footsteps approaching the end. He was about to be seen.\n\n*Make a decision, Marco!* he thought to himself, \n\n\n\n*TAKE ONE!*\n\n\n\nAfter a few seconds, the mystery person made it to the end of the hall. He was pushing a trolley filled with boxes of records. When he turned and looked down the hall, he saw...nothing out of the ordinary. Suspecting nothing, he continued to open nearby cabinets. Unbeknownst to him, Marco had taken a folder and made it out of sight in the nick of time. Still aware he was in danger of getting caught, Marco quietly made it to the door the mystery person came in through, which seemed to be the exit.\n\nMarco looked behind him and realized that the door here was the same as the door he came in through, except in better condition. He pulled out the rusty key once more and, making sure to make as little sound as possible, he inserted the key into the keyhole and twisted it. Wincing, he slowly pulled the door open, praying to himself that it wouldn't make a sound. Thankfully, it didn't, and neither did him closing it. He laid his back on the door and slid downward, awash with the feeling of relief.\n\nMeanwhile, Prairie and Glenn were freaking out internally the whole time as they heard faint glimpses as to what Marco was going through. After one heart-pumping minute of this, they were also relieved when Marco finally came back on.\n\n“I made it out...I got it.“\n\n“Jusko. Bumalik ka na dito!“ Prairie told him.\n\nMarco stood up and checked the folder he took, remembering that he may have swiped the wrong R. Villanueva. Another wave of relief washed over him when he read the name on the file - “Ramone Alekhine T. Villanueva“. However, Marco was not out of the weeds just yet. He now found himself in a cramped, dimly-lit underground corridor surrounded by rough concrete walls and lit with a handful of dim light bulbs. He wasn't able to see the end of it, but he was able to see a gap on the right wall around the middle of it.\n\n“Prairie, I'm in a long hallway now...do I go straight ahead or take a right?“\n\n“Di ko alam...“ Prairie answered as she looked at the floor plan again on Glenn's laptop.\n“Wala akong nakikitang hallway sa floor plan ko...di kita matutulungan diyan.“\n\nMarco was annoyed that he had to make a big decision again. He didn't want to leave something like this up to chance.\n\n“Are you sure it's not there? Check again...!“ he told her.\n\n“Pasensya na, Marco. Wala akong impormasyon tungkol dito. Kailangan mo gamitin ang kutob mo.“\n\nAlthough still annoyed, Marco agreed to do it. Trusting his gut, he decided to go straight ahead as carefully as he could, so as not to accidentally scratch himself on the walls. As he got to the end, there were no more lightbulbs to help him see, so he had to feel what was in front of him. After a short while, his hands grabbed onto what appeared to be a ladder. He started climbing...and climbing...and climbing, folder still in hand. This ladder seemed to be endless, and he was starting to get fearful from how high he was off the ground. Suddenly, his head hit the ceiling.\n\nThis was the exit, he realized. He felt around for a handle and grabbed one. He moved it to the side and was blessed by the sight of sunlight. He moved the cover out of the way, climbed out, and moved it back on. He had escaped the Records Room. Before he celebrated, he rushed back to the Admin Building to get the grapple he left at the elevator shaft. He pulled the elevator doors back together as best he could and finally walked out of the Admin Building.\n\n“Mission accomplished,“ he told Prairie and Glenn as he headed towards one of the drop-off gazebos. Upon hearing this, the pair were overjoyed and lightly high-fived again in the library before beginning to pack up. Marco sat down at the nearest gazebo and began reading the file. There he saw Ramone's address, which he could tell was put in recently from the whiteout underneath it. \n\n“Pasig...?“ he thought to himself as he read it in his head.\n“I can commute there if I'm careful enough,“ he thought further as he remembered that his mom was going to another conference tomorrow. He snapped a picture of the file, keeping the address to himself. Once again, he didn't want anyone else getting hurt because of him.\n\nHe was going to go it alone. \n\nThe elusive Ramone had been found.\n\n   "

    "content": "The next day, Marco woke up early once more, eagerly waiting for his mom to leave once more. Soon, she took the car and left for her conference, prompting Marco to spring into action. The night before, he planned a route that should've led to the address on the file, but Marco knew he still had to be careful. He had never been to this area before, and one misstep could lead to the worst case scenario - his mom coming back home before he did. For a few minutes, he was in familiar territory - until he hopped on the public bus.\n\nHe had only ridden one a couple times before, so this was a relatively new experience for him. He paid the driver and sat down, waiting for it to start moving. No one sat beside him, which was a slight relief to Marco. He rode the bus for an hour without any issues before leaving and going on the MRT. He had ridden it a few times before with his dad, so this was more familiar to him. This time it was more cramped, so he had to stand up and hold the railing. He took the train for a while, his legs nearly giving in from the amount of time he spent standing up. Soon, the train made it to his stop and he got off, collapsing at a nearby seating area.\n\nAfter a few minutes, he regained his energy and began the final step of the journey - walking to the address. Unfortunately, it began to rain. The sky turned a sickly gray, which only served to increase Marco's worries. It would only take a few minutes, but he was still on high alert being so far away from home. He took out his umbrella and stayed on the sidewalk, making sure to be aware of his surroundings while checking how close he was on his phone at the same time. After what seemed like an eternity, he made it. The street number matched, the house number matched - this was it.\n\nThis was Ramone's house.\n\nMarco took a deep breath and walked up to the front door, resting his finger on the doorbell. He looked around and saw nothing out of the ordinary, aside from a yellow sign he couldn’t make out from where he was standing. After a bit of hesitation, mainly out of fear, he pressed his finger down. A typical doorbell jingle played as Marco put his finger away, still holding the umbrella as the rain continued to pour. \n\n“Ramone! Pabuksan yung pinto!“ he heard a muffled voice shout from inside, which confirmed to him that he was in the right place. All he could do now was wait for them to get the door. He didn't have to wait a while, because a few seconds later, the door in front of him clicked - then opened. It was them.\n\n“Sino ka...?“ they asked as soon as they saw Marco. They spoke in a monotone voice with a face that didn’t express a readable emotion, which put off Marco slightly.\n“Are you Ramone Villanueva?“ Marco asked them back. Ramone opted to remain silent - they felt Marco looked familiar, but didn't know why. Suddenly, it hit them.\n“Are you from Pisay...?“ they asked, maintaining their tone from earlier.\n“Yes...“ Marco replied, “...I'm here for the drive.“\nAs soon as they heard this, Ramone quickly tried to shut the door, fearing that the Rising Phoenix finally found them. Marco quickly held his hand out and stopped the door.\n\n“Wait...!“ Marco exclaimed, “I'm trying to stop the Rising Phoenix, I'm not part of them!“\n“And why should I believe you...?“ Ramone asked with a hint of anger in their voice.\n“Because I've poured my blood, sweat, and tears into taking them down and I'm not failing when I'm this close,“ he replied, still using his strength to keep the door open.\n“They beat me to a pulp, multiple times...they framed me for destroying school property. They've ruined me. And they're about to ruin all of Pisay too. You're the only one that can help me stop them,“ he continued.\n\nRamone let go of the door when they heard this.\n“...Ikaw ba yung nagwasak ng go-kart...?“ they asked.\n“I wasn't the one who crashed it, but yeah. That was me,“ he replied.\n“You were chasing them, weren't you...?“ Ramone asked, referring to the Rising Phoenix, to which Marco nodded.\n“You're Marco Madlangbayan then...“ they said.\n“Yup, that's me...“\n“I heard about that incident last week...I called off the exchange because I didn't want to do business in...chaotic conditions.“\n“So that's why...“\n“Aren't you the one that won a Physics competition for us?“\n“Mhm.“\n“So you're the *great* Marco. I didn't know you of all people were after them...“\n\nWith this, Ramone finally realized that Marco was on their side.\n“So you heard about the drive...“ Ramone continued.\n“Yeah...I snuck into one of their meetings. That's how I know,“ Marco replied, which deeply impressed Ramone.\n“What do you know about it?“ they pressed on.\n“All I know is that the Rising Phoenix needs it...and that it's the only way to stop this thing called the S.P.E.C.T.R.E. program. Do you know anything about that...?“\nRamone chuckled lightly.\n“So that's all you know...“ they said condescendingly as they looked at the ground.\n“Am I missing something...?“ Marco asked worriedly.\n\n“Yes…a lot of it. Allow me to enlighten you...“ Ramone told him. They paused for a few seconds, staring at the ground. Marco waited patiently for what they were about to say. Soon, they began their spiel.\n“S.P.E.C.T.R.E. stands for 'Specially Programmed Extensive Code To Ravage Everything'...“ Ramone explained.\n“It's a virus I helped program with Overclock and Voltage while I was still part of the Rising Phoenix. We designed it to infect *every single computer* it could reach - all while staying completely undetectable...hence, the acronym. It was some of my finest code. I would've put it on my resumé if it wasn't illegal.“\n\nMarco was taken aback. He couldn’t have possibly imagined this was what S.P.E.C.T.R.E. truly was.\n“And what happens after it infects a computer...?“ Marco asked, curious but concerned at the same time.\n“It just stays there, dormant. Connected to other infected computers...until it receives the signal to wipe everything on it. *Everything.* Every computer...all at once,“ they explained further. At that moment, Marco could only think of the sheer destruction this program could cause. \n“Overclock's one of only a handful of people on the world that even know the exploit that makes it work. It's gone under the nose of every chip manufacturer in the world. Voltage even found a way to get it to short the device it's on. Makes it even more dangerous than it already is,“ Ramone said as they finished their explanation of S.P.E.C.T.R.E.\n\nAfter Ramone finished, they both fell silent. Only the sound of the rain permeated the space around them. Marco stood still, staring at the ground. He was still struggling to process what he’d learned - the magnitude of the situation was crashing down on him, all at once. Soon, Ramone began to grow tired as the silence turned awkward.\n“Marco…?” they asked.\n“Oh, sorry…” he replied as he suddenly snapped out of it. The thoughts of what could happen if the program went off still raced around his mind.\n“So…what’s in the drive…?” Marco asked. Ramone took a deep breath and began to explain.\n“The drive is one of two authenticator keys. The other is most likely still with the Rising Phoenix.”\n\n“Without getting too technical, S.P.E.C.T.R.E. can only be modified on a specific type of computer with the drive plugged in. It will reject any attempts otherwise. We programmed it that way,” they told Marco, who was intrigued by the mention of a special type of computer.\n“Is it a computer that comes in a metal case, by any chance…?” he asked, partially joking.\n“You’re right…how do you know that?” Ramone asked, surprised by what Marco said.\n“Oh…one of the people I’m working with has a computer like that. It’s military-grade.”\n“What brand?”\n“Um…there’s a small logo with three stars and a V under the screen. Not sure what model though.”\nRamone was pleasantly surprised. Right then, they knew they found what they were looking for.\n\n“That’s the exact kind Overclock uses. You’re lucky…” they told Marco, “...but you need to be careful.”\n“Why?” Marco asked.\n“Overclock always looked over my shoulder when I worked on S.P.E.C.T.R.E. Right before I left, he asked me to find paths to the servers of the other Pisay campuses. I found it, put it in one of the drives, then he sealed it. He always used some sort of program to make the drive completely unmodifiable when he wasn’t around. Can’t wipe it, can’t add any files - nothing. I still haven’t cracked it. So if it ends up in their hands…”\n“...the other campuses go down too,” Marco finished. \n“I kept that drive and left that life behind as soon as my LOA was processed. I’ve been holding onto it in the hopes someone can use it to stop them…even though I know what else is in it,“ they continued.\n\nThe rain continued to pour as they discussed this highly sensitive topic. They once again fell silent, allowing the sound of the rain to seep back in. \n“Why *did* you leave…?” Marco asked out of curiosity. Ramone stood in silence for a while before answering the question.\n“They wanted too much from me…and I just couldn’t take it anymore. I was breaking my back for them everyday, and I got nothing in return. Not even a thank you,” they told him. \n“I was just a pawn in their game.”\n“...so when will S.P.E.C.T.R.E. activate…?” Marco asked Ramone.\n“Based on my estimates from when I was still there…around next week,” they replied, which took Marco aback.\n“Alright, we still have time. I need that drive and the identities of the Rising Phoenix, now,” Marco said gladly as he held his hand out to Ramone.\n\n“You really think I’m just going to give it to you…?” they said.\n\nThe slight smile on Marco’s face faded instantly. \n“...what do you mean?” Marco asked sternly.\n“The Rising Phoenix wants it…now you. It’s only fair I name a price. Consider it…reparations…for everything I went through,” they replied. Hearing this angered Marco greatly - he couldn’t afford to deal with this right now.\n“How much?” Marco asked reluctantly.\n“100,000 pesos, as always - and a slot in prom night. Pisay wouldn’t let me go.”\n“WHAT?!”\n“That is my final offer.”\nMarco began to fill up with rage and impatience. He couldn’t believe that with everything at stake, they would still try to exploit the situation for their own benefit.\n“Listen to me, Ramone…” he told them sternly, “...this is beyond money, or prom slots, or whatever you want for yourself. If you don’t give me this drive now, you’re risking the *future of Pisay itself…!*” Marco explained while holding back anger so as not to cause a scene.\n\n“We can negotiate if you want. How’s 90,000…?” Ramone proposed.\n“I didn’t come here to negotiate,” Marco told them firmly, which they weren’t expecting.\n“Oh well…if you’re not gonna take it, I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.”\n“I’m not leaving until you give it to me.”\n“You’ve got some guts, you know? Especially since I’m the one…holding all the cards,” Ramone remarked as they pulled out a few playing cards from their pocket, all of which had their edges sharpened. Marco was not amused and stood there in silence.\n“Regardless, I’m not giving it until I have my money *and* my slot,” they continued.\n\n“Is it in your house…?” Marco asked as he looked inside, contemplating whether he should rush in. Ramone noticed this and knew exactly what to say.\n“You see that sign over there?” they asked Marco as they pointed to a yellow sign posted on a nearby fence. Marco looked in that direction and saw what it said - “Beware of dogs”.\n“A few months ago, someone tried to break in…he got up over the fence. Got inside. It was then that our guard dogs woke up. They found him…and they tore him apart. Just a few feet from where we’re standing,” Ramone explained menacingly.\n“So unless you want me to open that gate, wake them up, and let them see you…I would suggest you either leave or we come to an agreement,” Ramone proposed.\n\nMarco weighed his options. He looked at the gate where the dogs were being kept, then back at Ramone, then to the inside of the house. This continued a few more times before he came to a decision.\n“Alright…” he relented. “I’ll find a way to get you into prom. As soon as we’re there, you give me the drive,” he told them. Ramone nodded in agreement, delighted that they got exactly what they asked for.\n“Before you go, you’re going to need this…” Ramone told him. They then spouted off a long string of numbers and letters, which Marco scrambled to note down on his phone.\n\n“What was that…?” Marco asked, confused.\n“That’s the address of my crypto wallet. Send my money there,” they told Marco before giving detailed instructions on what site to use.\n“That’s all. See you at prom,” Ramone told Marco, almost taunting him.\n“This isn’t over,” he told them. He slowly turned around and reopened his umbrella, as the rain was still pouring. He walked off and began the long trek back home. Ramone shut the door as soon as he was far enough and quickly sat down. \n\n“Papa!” they called out.\n“Ano…?” their dad asked.\n\n\n“Ihanda mo na yung isusuot ko sa prom...pupunta ako.” \n\n\n\t"

    "content": "After making it back home safely and going to sleep at his usual time, Marco went back to classes as usual on what seemed like an ordinary Friday. When lunch rolled around, he quickly made his way to the spot he told Glenn and Prairie to meet with in private - the equipment room between ASTB 201 and 203. After looking around to make sure no one saw him, he went into the room and quietly shut the door. The room was filled with machines and glassware for Research purposes, reminding Marco of his own Research project, which made him uneasy. Strangely, he heard some clattering and footsteps on the far end of the room. When he decided to check it out, his heart nearly skipped a beat when he saw someone else. Turns out, it was just Brianna.\n\n\t“Geez, you scared me…” Marco told her.\n\t“Hey…” Brianna replied nonchalantly as she held two beakers in her hands. Silence filled the room for a few seconds as the two tried to think of something to lessen the awkwardness of the situation.\n\t“Sorry, I’m just meeting with Glenn and Prairie about Rising Phoenix stuff…” Marco explained to her.\n\t“OK…can I stay? I’m in the middle of something right now,” Brianna asked.\n\t“Sure, that’s not a problem…” Marco assured her. After a few more awkward seconds, Glenn and Prairie finally arrived.\n\n\t“Pasensya na...lumagpas sa oras yung SocSci namin,” Prairie explained as she and Glenn entered the room.\n\t“Yeah…what she said,” Glenn remarked as he closed the door behind them.\n\t“Anong bago?” Prairie asked enthusiastically.\n\t“Well, yesterday I made my way to Ramone’s address, and they were in fact living there.”\n\t“Nice,” Glenn told him.\n\t“Thing is…I wasn’t able to get the drive from them.”\n\t“Aaaand there it is.”\n\n\t“Teka, anong nangyari?” Prairie asked, concerned.\n\t“Before I explain, I need to tell you guys what I learned about the S.P.E.C.T.R.E. program. It’s…crazy stuff,” he told them both. He proceeded to tell them about the nature of S.P.E.C.T.R.E., from its potential as a catalyst for mass destruction to the critical role the drive plays in stopping it from executing. As Marco explained all of this, Brianna slowly began to listen out of intrigue.\n\t“Anyway, that’s all you guys need to know about S.P.E.C.T.R.E. and the drive,” Marco concluded.\n\t“OK. Why don’t you have the drive then?” Glenn asked semi-snarkily.\n\t“They wanted 100,000 pesos sent to this Bitcoin address and a slot to prom night,” Marco explained as he showed the two the address he received, “...and they threatened to release their guard dogs on me, so I had to back down.”\n\t“100,000?!” Glenn blurted out as he put his hands on his head.\n\t“At isang slot sa prom? Pero isang linggo nang tapos ang prom reservation...! Hindi na kami puwedeng magdagdag ng tao!” Prairie added.\n\n\t“That’s the least of our problems…” Marco remarked, “...how are we supposed to pay them 100,000 pesos…?!”\n\t“Wait…give me your phone,” Glenn told Marco. He quickly complied and gave it to Glenn, who took a second look at the wallet address along with the site Ramone instructed Marco to use.\n\t“This site looks relatively niche…if the conditions are right, I may be able to use my laptop to breach it and override the server-side database to visually modify certain numbers temporarily,” Glenn explained.\n\t“Does that include changing the money count on the wallets…?” Marco asked.\n\t“Let me check,” Glenn remarked as he visited the transfer site and examined the source code. There were certain traits he was looking for to see if it was possible.\n\t“Yes…I can breach this,” Glenn confirmed, prompting Marco to sigh in relief. Brianna continued to watch the whole thing unfold from the far corner of the room.\n\n“Alright, that’s settled…not sure how we’ll deal with the prom slot. Like Prairie said, it’s final…” Marco told the two. As he said this, Prairie got an idea.\n“Paano kung hindi ako pumunta...at kunin nalang ni Ramone ang aking puwesto?” she suggested. Marco and Glenn fell silent when they heard this. Even Brianna was surprised by the suggestion.\n“No…that’s not fair. We’ll find another way…” Marco told her.\n“Pag-isipan mo. Ikaw ang kinausap ni Ramone, kaya kailangan nandoon ka - at kailangan nandoon si Glenn para i-hack yung crypto wallet. Ako lang ang pwedeng maiwan. Saka, ayoko naman talaga pumunta…” she explained.\nMarco was rendered speechless. He didn’t want to have to sacrifice someone else’s prom experience for this, but judging by the circumstances and the high stakes, he realized it was the only way - and so did Glenn.\n“I think you’re right. If you’re the one who stays home, I don’t think anybody would notice,” Glenn remarked.\n\n“Okay...and how will we get Ramone to replace you on the list?” he asked, trying his best to ignore the implications of what Glenn just said.\n“I can do that,” Brianna chimed in. All three of them turned around, surprised that she had something to say.\n“I’m in the prom committee…they haven’t printed the lists out yet for the registration. I can do some convincing to give me edit access to the list. Then I can swap out Prairie for Ramone,” she told the three.\n“Looks like you’re finally useful again,” he told Brianna. Glenn and Prairie stared at them uncomfortably, trying their best to ignore the implications of what Marco just said.\n\n“Alright, looks like we have a plan,” Marco told them all.\n“Ako na bahalang kumausap sa magulang ko tungkol sa bakit di ako makapupunta...kung may kailangan kayo sa akin, sabihan niyo na lang ako sa Discord,” Prairie told Marco.\n“By the way, make sure to bring your laptop to prom, alright?” Marco told Glenn, who gave him a thumbs-up.\nAs he watched Prairie polish the notes on her notepad and Glenn examine the website further, he felt an overwhelming sense of pride for how far they’d all come. Prairie then began to explain some other things to Marco, but he started to zone out after turning around and realizing who was missing from it all - Brianna. She was still at the back working on her research project while they all discussed the plan.\n\n“Alright, I’m done…” Brianna told the three of them as she put down her glassware. She made her way to the door and opened it a crack when Marco stopped her.\n“Yes?” Brianna asked as she turned towards him. However, he couldn’t manage to get anything off his mouth. After a few awkward seconds, Brianna decided to leave.\n“Alright…good luck guys,” she told them before closing the door. Marco’s guilt continued to build up inside him as he stared at the closed door.\n“Um, anyway…meeting dismissed! Just work on your tasks, we can do this…!” he told Glenn and Prairie, which slightly boosted their confidence in the mission. Marco then hurriedly left the room as he looked at his watch, making sure to go in the opposite direction as Brianna.\n\nMarco quickly ran to the koi pond in the middle of the SHB - he had agreed earlier that day to meet Darren there. When he got there, he saw Darren gleefully watching the koi swimming around. After hearing the door open, he turned around and saw Marco. \n“Hi Marco!” he said as he waved at him. Marco smiled back upon seeing this. He then went up beside Darren, who shortly rested his elbows on the rocky rim of the koi pond after.\n“This is an underrated spot…it’s beautiful,” Darren said as he looked up and admired the beauty of the atrium surrounding the koi pond - the various plants and trees reaching high up into the sky, the dew resting on their leaves, and the ledges protruding off each floor, creating an interesting pattern.\n“I hadn’t noticed,” Marco told Darren as he looked at him.\n\n“Aray...dapat di ko dito pinatong yung siko ko.” Darren commented as he took his elbows off the rim in pain. Him and Marco had a quick chuckle about it before watching the koi swim around.\n“You know…I can’t believe it’s almost over,” Marco told Darren.\n“What do you mean?”\n“I’m close to cracking the Rising Phoenix case, I can just feel it. I’m just so hopeful right now, you know?”\n“I’m glad you do.”\nThe pair watched the koi swim for a while before conversing once more.\n\n“What are you gonna to do after this is all over…?” Darren asked.\n“I don’t know, honestly. I don’t feel like I even *have* a purpose outside of stopping the Rising Phoenix.”\n“Well…maybe our purpose is to hope,” Darren told Marco, who looked back up at him.\n“Then I hope I get to spend more time with you,” Marco replied.\n“Me too, Marco.”\nWith that, the two of them inched closer together as they continued to watch the koi swim around.\n\nBut little did they know, another student was watching them.\n\nHe stood at the glass behind them and stared emotionlessly at the pair, envying what they had. In his right hand was a folder containing a few pieces of paper. He stood there for another minute before straightening his clothes and making his way to the Discipline Office. After ringing the doorbell outside, Sir Ernest promptly opened the door.\n“Alonso,” Sir Ernest said as he saw the student, “Pasok ka.”\nAlonso sat down on the couch and plopped the folder down on the table. It was labeled “PROOF” on top with black marker.\n“Ano ‘to…?” Sir asked earnestly.\n“I’ve been investigating the Rising Phoenix as well,” Alonso explained, “...and I’ve found concrete proof of the true identity of their leader.”\nSir Ernest was immediately intrigued upon hearing this.\n\nAlonso opened the folder, revealing the first page - a picture of Marco wearing the Rising Phoenix’s signature bird mask. He gave the page to Sir Ernest for him to examine while he took out the rest of the pages, which contained fabricated message logs of Marco directing the Rising Phoenix.\n\t“Sabi ko na nga ba...” Sir Ernest muttered under his breath.\n“Alam mo ba kung nasaan si Marco?” Sir asked Alonso.\n“No,” he replied.\n“Sige...kakausapin ko siya kapag nakita ko siya. Salamat at nasabi mo ‘to sa akin...” Sir told him, “Sorry, may meeting pa ako…kailangan ko nang umalis. Kung tingin mo may iba pa akong kailangan malaman, i-email mo lang ako.”\nSir Ernest quickly packed his things and left the Discipline Office, with Alonso following suit. After Sir Ernest was out of sight, Alonso quickly headed to the back of the ASTB for privacy. There, he took out his burner phone and called someone. Soon, the person on the other end picked up.\n\n“Ginawa mo na…?” the mysterious person asked in a garbled voice, the same one Marco heard from his recording device at the 4F Audi.\n“Yes…I did it. Sir seems to believe it,” Alonso told them.\n“Salamat, Obsidian. Alam kong mapagtitiwalaan kita.”\n“Anything for you, my love,” Obsidian replied.\n“Mahal kita.”\n“You too…” he said unenthusiastically before hanging up.\n\nAfter the call, he left the back of the ASTB, prepared to carry out whatever was needed in the name of the Rising Phoenix.\n\n\n\t"

    "content": "*Ring, ring!*\n*Ring - *\n\n\tMarco swiftly turned off the alarm that he was all too familiar with. It had been two days since he informed the Dexterous Detectives about their mission - and it was now just one hour before prom. Marco took the cheap store-bought mask his mom bought earlier to follow the prom’s theme, which was masquerade. He then pulled out the black suit in his wardrobe and hurriedly dressed for the occasion, making sure to keep Glenn’s earpieces in his pocket. After combing his hair and polishing his looks further, Marco got in the car with his mom and began to head to the venue. The batch before Marco’s went all out, reserving the Tiago Rodriguez Ballroom - a venue reserved for the greatest and most opulent of celebrations. As such, Marco was excited to see it in person.\n\n\tAs he got closer and closer to his destination, Marco contemplated his journey so far. How he, along with his teammates, had gone through so much uncertainty and turmoil - all coming down to this one night. He looked out the car window the whole time as the finality of it all began to dawn on him. A few minutes before he arrived however, his thinking spree was cut short when his mom decided to remind him of something.\n“Son, if there’s alcohol over there, don’t drink it, OK? You’re not yet 18,” she told him, which annoyed Marco since he recalled telling her there wasn’t any a few days ago.\n“Mama, I already told you they’re not serving alcohol! Did you even read the consent form?!” Marco fired back.\n\n“Hey, don’t get shouty with me! I just want to make sure you don’t get yourself into trouble!” Marco’s mom replied.\n“What, you don’t trust me not to?”\n“No!” Marco’s mom told him, “In fact, I don’t!” \nHearing this from his own mother took Marco aback.\n“You don’t trust your own *son*?!”\n“You *know* what you did! I can’t trust you after that…not for a long time…!”\n“You know, I did that for the right reasons! Reasons you wouldn’t understand!”\n“What *reasons*?! That’s nonsense!” Marco’s mom told him before sighing in disappointment. At that moment, they pulled up to the entrance of the Tiago Rodriguez ballroom. \n“Papa wouldn’t be happy with you,” Marco’s mom muttered under her breath. Marco heard it and desperately wanted to say something, but he barely managed to hold back. They stayed silent until Marco was about to be dropped off.\n\n“Have fun…” Marco’s mom told him unenthusiastically. Marco quickly got out of the car and slammed the door, refusing to acknowledge his mom, who drove off after seeing Marco make it to the stairs of the venue. Marco stopped for a moment to put on his masquerade mask, which was blue with some patterning and feathers on the rim. The entrance was decorated with red and black balloon towers and streamers - the balloons had prints of various masquerade masks on them, which seemed to be peeling off already. He also saw some of his batchmates and upper-years talking outside, all wearing masks of various colors and shapes. Walking past them, he followed the red carpet set on the stairs and made it inside.\n\nWhen he got in, Marco was mesmerized at the sight before him. He was in a large hallway with a ceiling that was at least a few storeys tall, making him feel miniscule in comparison. Everything from the walls to the pillars to the ceiling were made of stone and marble and carved with the most intricate and beautiful patterns. Large wooden doors populated the walls, all of which led to smaller rooms compared to the ballroom, whose entrance lay at the end of the hallway. \n\nTwo large chandeliers lit up the whole hallway and gave a feeling of warmth to the whole room - along with a sense of grandiosity. Every element of the building’s architecture was something to marvel at. Taking his attention off the beauty of the interior, Marco looked at what the upper-years set up and saw a mask-themed photoshoot site with a long line, a decently-sized group of parents talking to each other, and a registration booth for the prom attendees near the entrance.\n\nMarco quickly made his way to the registration booth and looked for his name on the attendance sheets. In the corner of his eye, he saw someone watching him do so, which put him on edge. He looked over at Prairie’s block and looked for where her name would be and saw Ramone’s name in its place instead, which gave him a sense of relief. He also noticed that it was already signed, so they were there already.\n“Real quick, I need to note your name down too. Please state your name,” the girl looking after the registration booth told Marco.\n“Madlangbayan,” he told her. She looked up at him, slightly unamused.\n“...Marco Madlangbayan.”\nAfter she noted down his name and gave him the go-ahead, he looked up and saw that the person watching him had vanished. He hesitantly brushed it off, leaving the registration booth and walking down the red carpet. He strutted down it with confidence and style, empowered by hope for his deal with Ramone. He put on his earpieces and adjusted his cuffs as well, which made some people turn their heads.\n\nBefore he made it to the ballroom entrance, Marco bumped into Brianna - she was wearing a silky red dress paired with an eye-catching black mask, forming a killer look.\n“I believe I deserve some thanks,” Brianna told him, referring to her getting Ramone on the list.\n“Oh wow…hey Bri!” he said, clearly surprised.\n“Looks good, right?”\n“Yeah…good for you,” Marco replied. The two of them stood silently for a while, which quickly turned the conversation awkward.\n“Anyway, I’m gonna go. I’ll try to enjoy the prom,” Brianna said as she entered the ballroom.\n\nMarco followed her inside and was hit with yet another beautiful sight. The ballroom was filled with the same intricate patterns and marvelous architecture as the hallway he came from, except it was much more spacious and lofty. There were two floors - the first was on ground level, which was filled with tables draped with white cloth, stacked with eating utensils and plates along with a candelabra centerpiece, and masquerade-themed decorations surrounding them. On his right was a medium-sized stage with a giant LED screen and an abundance of commercial-grade speakers flanking both sides of it - the screen displayed a themed title card for the prom. All the tables were arranged in a way to leave a big rectangular space in the middle for dancing.\n\nOn his left were a few doors at the back leading to some small service rooms, in front of which were three buffet tables for the dinner service. Right a few feet from him was the staircase to the second floor, which consisted of a small area that acted like a balcony that could oversee the ballroom from high above. Despite being barricaded off by a single red stanchion with a warning note taped on it, the second floor still seemed to have fully prepared tables. Marco was slightly confused by this, but figured it was supposed to be for the ASAs. \n\nHanging high above everything in the ballroom was a gargantuan glass chandelier that sparkled beautifully and lit up the whole room. As he looked around, he observed even more gorgeous masks that were sure to land high on a crowd vote. After fully taking in the scenery, Marco began making his way to his table, which was close to the entrance and fairly distant from the stage. On his way there, he was stopped by a familiar face.\n\n“Hi Marco!” Darren’s familiar voice called out.\n“Hey, Darren.”\n“Come, I’ll show you your seat. Are you glad I reserved it for you?”\n“Probably broke a rule of some kind, but yeah, I guess I am.”\n“Over here…!” Darren said as he motioned to Marco.\nAfter a few seconds of traversing through the chairs and people, Marco finally made it to his seat. He sat down and relaxed for a bit, mentally preparing himself for the deal with Ramone. After spotting some peanuts in a small dish on the table, Marco snacked on a few of them to stave off his nervousness. \n“Marco, so…what do you - ”\n“Sorry, not now,” Marco interrupted Darren as he looked around for Glenn, who he had still not seen, and for Ramone themself. Thankfully, Glenn came in right that moment.\n\n“Hi…did I miss anything?” Glenn asked as he plopped his laptop on the table.\n“No,” Marco reassured him. Glenn quickly opened his laptop under the tablecloth and kickstarted every necessary program for the mission.\n“Have you seen Ramone?” Marco asked.\n“I saw them coming into the ballroom, they’re probably going to their seat right now…” Glenn informed Marco, who spotted them walking around right as he said that. From the glimpse Marco caught, they were wearing a black suit and bowtie, a red shirt, and a mask that seemed to be their Rising Phoenix mask painted black and decorated and modified slightly. As all this was happening, Darren just sat there and watched the two of them talk about this.\n\n“Yeah, that’s them alright,” Marco confirmed.\n“I have the transfer site ready for control. Whenever you need me to spoof the transaction, just message me. And remember, the spoof will only stay that way for *2 minutes*, so don’t linger!” Glenn told Marco as he was about to get up to approach Ramone.\n“Thanks, wish me luck…” Marco told Glenn.\n“Good luck!” Darren called out, which prompted a slightly confused look from Glenn.\nMeanwhile, Marco waded through all of the people blocking him as he made his way to Ramone, who he was laser-focused on. After making it to the back, which didn’t have many people in it, he dashed towards Ramone as fast as he could, which let him finally catch up with them.\n“Ramone…” Marco said slightly out of breath, “...I’m here.”\nRamone slowly turned around and confirmed that it was, indeed, Marco.\n“It’s about time you showed up,” they remarked, “Come with me.”\n\nRamone walked to the back door that was the furthest away from all the people, who were beginning to go back to their seats as the prom was about to start. Marco followed closely behind before Ramone stopped. They twisted the knob and pushed the door open. Marco sensed that Ramone improvised this, as they had a sense of relief on their face when it opened. They quickly went inside and motioned at Marco to come in too, which he did.\n\nAs Ramone closed the door, Marco knew that the deal was about to begin. \n\n\t"

    "content": "Right before Ramone closed the door, they found the light switch to the then pitch-black room and flicked it on. They could both hear the emcee on stage starting the prom. After shutting the door, one single incandescent light bulb hanging from the ceiling turned on, providing a weak source of ambient lighting for the whole room. The room seemed to be constructed differently and in a rather decrepit state, a far cry from the rest of the venue. The paint was starting to peel off, revealing the concrete behind it, which made the room feel like an afterthought. It seemed like it was just being used to dump whatever wasn’t being used, as evidenced by all the broken wooden chairs and tables inside. All of this made Marco feel incredibly uneasy.\n\n\tRamone placed a chair under the doorknob to keep it from opening before dragging a table and two other chairs into position. They then sat down in one of them.\n\t“Have a seat,” they told Marco, holding out their hand towards the chair opposite them on the far end of the table. Marco sat down and got as comfortable as he possibly could. As he did so, Ramone reached into their suit, pulled something out, and plopped it down on the table. And when Marco got a look at it, he knew right then that he was looking at the real thing - it was the drive. It was colored a deep black with a Rising Phoenix emblem etched onto it in red, along with a silicone cover on top to protect it from harm.\n\t“This is what you wanted,” Ramone explained, “...so now I need my money.”\n\n\t“Alright, I’ll have it wired to your account…” Marco told them. He quickly took his phone out from under the table and began to message Glenn.\n\t“Do it now” was the message Glenn received, which he caught immediately despite the prom swinging in full force around him. He typed in a few commands, and after a few seconds, the fake payment went through. Ramone looked at their account through their burner phone and noted that 100,000 pesos worth of Bitcoin was indeed transferred to their account.\n\t“There’s your money. Now give me the drive,” Marco said sternly as he reached out his hand. However, Ramone had other ideas.\n\t“No…let’s wait here a while,” they told him. Marco’s nerves immediately spiked upon hearing this.\n\t“Why…?” Marco asked.\n\t“Because I’m not an idiot.”\n\n\t“I know the transfer site I use has…an issue. I keep trying to tell the creators to fix it, that it’s my *only* problem with it…but they still haven’t listened to me. So for the meantime, we wait right here until I know for a *fact* that this transaction is real,” Ramone explained. Marco froze - he didn’t know what to do from here. The jig was up.\n\t“While we’re here, let’s play some blackjack. Haven’t gotten to play anyone in a while…” Ramone said as they started pulling out cards from their suit pocket, the same ones they flaunted at their house. Marco’s head was spinning - he knew he had to get out of here with the drive, quick. He looked at the drive, which was right on the table, which itself seemed very rickety. Right then, he knew what he was going to do. There would be no other opportunity.\n\n\tIn nearly an instant, Marco shoved the table as hard as he could at Ramone, knocking them back and causing them to nearly fall off their chair. They frantically reached for the drive, which was still on the table, but the table’s flimsiness had caused its legs to break and bend towards them. The drive slid down towards Marco right before Ramone could grab it, and he took it as soon as it was within arm’s reach. The moment he did, he ran right to the door, but remembered then that he still had to remove the chair from the doorknob. While he scrambled to remove it, Ramone threw a volley of sharpened playing cards right at him, creating puncture marks on his suit - with one even embedding itself into the wood of the chair. After what felt like an eternity, Marco got the chair off and tossed it at Ramone, breaking it on impact. He swung the door open, got out, and slammed it shut.\n\n\tEveryone in the prom was busy playing a game the emcee just started, which thankfully distracted them from Marco. He quickly ran towards him and Glenn’s table, clutching the drive tightly in his right hand. Before he could make it there however, he noticed two guys slowly walking towards him from the direction he was going. He didn’t recognize them at first, but it suddenly hit him - these were Wildfire and Heatwave, the same guys that beat him to a pulp in the 3rd Floor Audi and made him fall through the roof. They were here. Marco momentarily stopped and looked around to see how he could go around them, but he ended up getting a glimpse of more suspicious people coming up to him from the southwest.\n\n\tSuddenly, Marco bumped into Sir Ernest, who was taking a look at the dinner options. Wildfire held his hand out, and all the suspicious people stopped in their tracks.\n\t“Marco...gusto kitang kausapin,” Sir Ernest muttered menacingly. Marco tried to side-step him, but he just side-stepped as well.\n\t“Nakatanggap ako ng ebidensiya na nagpapatunay na nagsisinungaling ka sa akin. *Ikaw* ang tunay na lider ng Rising Phoenix.” Sir explained, which baffled Marco.\n\t“What?! What evidence? That’s not true!” Marco told him.\n\t“Wag ka nang magsalita. Hahayaan kitang magsaya sa prom, pero hindi ko ito palalagpasin. Magkita tayo sa DO bukas.” Sir Ernest concluded as he went back to his table. Marco couldn’t help but stand there in shock after what he heard. Soon, after Sir Ernest was far enough away, the suspicious people quickly advanced towards Marco once more. He noticed this and jumped back into action.\n\n\tThinking quickly, Marco jumped over the red stanchion blocking access to the second floor. When he looked up the staircase, he saw someone that stopped him in his tracks - it was Obsidian. He was in a black suit and masquerade mask like most of the prom attendees; he stood there with a terrified and regretful look in his eyes. He was still wearing his signature black coat, which he had wrapped tightly around himself. Marco’s instincts kicked in and he ran up the stairs to Obsidian as fast as possible, nearly tripping over some of the steps in the process. Obsidian, meanwhile, dashed away from the staircase, desperately trying to get away from Marco. Once he got to the top, Marco saw the full second floor, which included a multitude of small balconies outside on the left he hadn’t seen before, and Obsidian standing right in the middle.\n\n\tMarco, full of anger and adrenaline, ran over and tackled Obsidian - sending them both crashing to the ground.\n\t“Got you…!” Marco said through gritted teeth.\n\t“Ow! Please, get off me! We don’t have much time…!” Obsidian pleaded.\n\t“Not before I get that mask off!” Marco fired back. He reached for Obsidian’s mask before he hastily took it off himself, which surprised Marco.\n\t“My…legal name…is Alonso Datumanong. I’m not the one you’re looking for.”\n\t“Nice try! You’re Obsidian! *Of course* you’re the one I’m after!”\n\t“No, Marco,” he clarified, “…I’m not the *real* leader of the Rising Phoenix.”\n\n\tMarco was confused by this. He decided to get off Obsidian to get a chance to hear his story.\n\t“Yes, I do lead the others, but someone else gives me the orders…! It’s…someone you know,” Obsidian frantically explained as his eyes darted around the room.\n\t“Someone I know?! Wait, who…?” Marco asked, stunned by this newfound revelation.\n\t“This was a mistake, I shouldn’t have done this…” Obsidian mumbled as he put his hands on his head and paced around.\n\t“WHO?!” Marco yelled out.\n\t“It’s…it’s - ”\n\tZAP! A jolt of electricity quickly incapacitated Obsidian. He fell down to the ground unconscious, revealing Voltage to have been behind the electrocution, armed with a repaired taser. Alongside her were her fighters - Celsius and Fahrenheit.\n\n\tMarco quickly backed up, hoping not to get tased himself. But Voltage and her fighters just stood there. Behind them, Overclock came in, along with Wildfire and Heatwave. Marco recognized Overclock’s giant metal gauntlet - it was the same one that knocked him out cold after the go-kart crash.\n\t“Clean this up,” Overclock said to Voltage and her fighters as he pointed at Obsidian’s unconscious body, prompting them to drag it somewhere else out of sight. Overclock, Wildfire, and Heatwave stepped closer towards Marco, with Overclock being front and center. Marco looked around and saw a camera pointed to the second floor.\n\t“We’re already in their system. That camera won’t save you,” he said menacingly as Wildfire and Heatwave chuckled slightly. In the background, the prom celebration still went on. They had begun to play musical chairs, and the speakers were sure to drown out any loud noises.\n\n\t“What are you gonna do to me…?” Marco asked.\n\t“We’re going to *beat* that drive out of you,” Overclock replied as he smacked his gauntlet-wearing fist onto his free palm, “...no matter what it takes.”\n\tMarco stayed alert, preparing himself for when the three of them would strike. He shoved the drive deep into his suit pocket and prepared for a fight. Down below, the emcee was about to begin the first round of musical chairs. \n\nThen - loud music blasted throughout the whole venue.\n\n\tWildfire went in and threw a volley of punches at Marco. He saw every punch coming and either dodged or blocked them right on time, signaling to all of them that he would not go down without a fight. He quickly kicked him to a nearby table with all his might. As he did so, Marco was blindsided by Heatwave, who ran up and tackled him over the table, toppling it over and pulling the tablecloth off. Glasses and plates crashed to the floor as the two landed on the ground. Marco quickly got up again, but Overclock was there waiting. He punched Marco in the side with the gauntlet, sending him falling far away.\n\nAlthough in quite some pain, Marco managed to prop himself back up with a nearby table. He grabbed a nearby plate and tossed it at Overclock, but he managed to shatter it mid-air, sending plate fragments raining down the sides of him. At that very moment, the music blaring in the background cut out, and all the attendees down below were yelling and cheering as they saw who managed to sit on the chairs and who didn’t. Overclock realized they’d all have to be quiet when fighting whenever this happened. However, Marco managed to disappear while they were momentarily distracted by the plate smashing. He’d managed to get under the table and crawl under another.\n\nOverclock, Wildfire, and Heatwave all split up to look under the tables and find Marco. They frantically lifted all the tablecloths to find him, but then Overclock saw one move. He made a quiet gesture to Wildfire and Heatwave that he’d found him. He slowly walked up to the table and lifted the tablecloth, but he ended up getting a faceful of Marco’s shoe. Right then, the music went back on full blast and the game below continued. As Overclock clutched his face in pain, Wildfire went under the table and grabbed Marco’s foot, to which Marco held onto the giant middle table leg to stop him from getting pulled in. He kicked Wildfire in the face, breaking his grip and allowing Marco to come out from under the table.\n\nThe moment he did, Heatwave grabbed him and threw him onto another table, flipping over and shattering even more glasses and plates. He grabbed one of the broken wine glasses on the floor and began using it to take swings at Marco, who carefully dodged them and kept his distance. He soon ran back into a table and was about to get stabbed by Heatwave when he thought of something. He grabbed the tablecloth and held it up in front of him, stopping the glass from making contact. With that, he threw the part of the tablecloth he grabbed, sending the glass straight to the ground.\n\nMarco quickly kicked Heatwave’s left leg, tripping him and making him fall to the fragment-laden ground. However, he ran into Overclock again, who was about to swing his gauntlet again. Thinking fast, Marco grabbed a nearby fallen table and rolled it in front of him. Overclock punched the table with such force that a piece of it broke, sending splinters flying everywhere. At that point, Wildfire had gotten back up and was ready to take another shot. He grabbed Marco and threw him across the second floor towards the balconies, right as the music cut out. In a lot of pain but still managing to bear through it, Marco limped towards one of the balconies.\n\nThe balcony had two wooden doors leading to it that were opened inward, with the balcony itself not being very spacious, only fitting three people at most.\nMarco propped himself on the stone railing and prepared to face them once more. He grabbed the left door and swung it back as hard as he could to hit a charging Wildfire, which worked. He then kicked Heatwave, who was attempting to approach from the right. Marco tried to run away from the balcony, but both Wildfire and Heatwave managed to grab him and throw him back. Heatwave went out to the balcony and cornered Marco, dealing a right to his face and a left to his side, just like in the 3rd Floor Audi. \n\n\tAs Marco tried to walk away, Wildfire came in and pushed him, sending him over the railing and hanging on for dear life. He tried to set his foot on the edge of the balcony, but he was not succeeding. Wildfire and Heatwave both backed off, letting Overclock come forward. \n\t“Look Marco, we can do this the *easy* way…or the hard way,” Overclock taunted as he smashed his gauntlet down near his hands, which were still barely clinging on, cracking the balcony railing slightly. Marco desperately looked for an escape to the situation, but he couldn’t find any. \n\t“Hard way it is!” Overclock called out as he smashed his gauntlet, nearly crushing Marco’s left hand had he not moved it inward in time. He did the same thing to Marco’s right hand, making it so that both of his hands were now in one spot.\n\n\tAs it seemed like all hope was lost, Marco got an idea. Right before Overclock was about to crush both of his hands, Marco let go and kicked the balcony with all his strength. Outside the venue was a garden, and Marco ended up landing safely in the shrubs. Out of breath, he quickly got out of the shrubs, not minding that his suit was now filthy - only being thankful that he survived with no major injuries. As Marco ran off, Overclock smashed the balcony again out of frustration. Marco managed to escape his grasp.\n\n\n\t"

    "content": "Marco walked around outside for a while trying to find a way back inside, eventually finding a dark wooden door at the back. He opened it and was hit with the noise coming from the musical chairs event, meaning he was indeed in the right place. He moved the curtain blocking the door out of the way and closed it firmly - he was now back inside, with no one noticing again as they were watching musical chairs. Marco quickly maneuvered around the tables, trying to make his way to Glenn. To lower the risk of him getting cornered, he moved his way through the crowd that formed around the dance floor to get a better look at the game.\n\n\tWhen Marco finally got out of the crowd, he was just a few feet away from him and Glenn’s table. At that moment, the emcee stopped the music once more. Marco then heard a burst of yelling - a winner had emerged. He was uninterested in the outcome and continued making his way to Glenn, whom he eventually reached.\n\t“I got it…” Marco told Glenn as he reached into his suit pocket and pulled out the drive.\n\t“My God, what happened to you?” Glenn asked, genuinely bewildered at the state of Marco’s outfit.\n\t“Just plug it in,” Marco told him, unamused, “...I’ll look out for anyone coming after us.”\n\tGlenn took the drive and examined it for a while before plugging it into his laptop. As Marco looked around nervously, Glenn’s laptop began decrypting the contents of the drive. However, it was taking a *really* long time.\n\n\tGlenn tried to copy the raw data off the drive instead, but his laptop ended up throwing a bunch of errors on-screen.\n\t“Glenn, I told you, you can’t modify the drive! It’s not possible!”\n\t“I didn’t know that meant you couldn’t *copy* stuff! What kind of drive is this?!”\n\t“I don’t know! Ramone told me the Rising Phoenix sealed it! You can only see those files when the drive’s in so just look at them already!”\n\t“Fine!” Glenn replied as he continued decrypting the contents of the drive. Behind Marco’s back however, Glenn began doing something else to the drive.\n\t“Hey…what’s going on here - ” Darren asked as he came in with a mocktail he got for himself.\n\t“Sorry Darren, we’re in the middle of something…” Marco interrupted as he saw Ramone wandering around, looking for him. Suddenly, someone accidentally bumped Glenn in the shoulder.\n\t“Sorry…” he said lightly as he continued walking. Glenn looked back at the laptop and was confused to find an error saying the drive was missing. Sure enough, after looking down at the USB port, the drive was gone.\n\t\n\t“Marco…someone took the drive!” Glenn told him frantically as he pointed at the guy who bumped into him. Quickly, Marco sprung into action and began chasing after him. Glenn said something to him, but he didn’t hear it with all the commotion. He pushed chairs and even other people aside as he tried to get to the thief, who was on their way to the dancefloor, which was just opened a minute ago. Meanwhile, Brianna was sitting at her table, sipping on a mocktail when she saw Marco whizz by, chasing after someone. She contemplated for a while, taking another sip in the process.\n\t“Eh,” she said to herself, staying in her seat and continuing to drink.\n\t\n\tMeanwhile, the thief managed to make his way into the dancefloor crowd, blending in seamlessly. By the time Marco made it inside, he could barely find the guy - he was wearing a black suit and a blue mask, something many people were wearing. As he continued to follow the thief around, Marco pushed through people who were happily dancing, which ignited the ire of some of them. He was so determined that he even pushed right through a couple who was about to kiss.\n\t“Hey!” the girl Marco bumped into yelled out. Her boyfriend quickly made a rude gesture at him involving a specific finger.\n\t\nAs Marco struggled to keep up with the guy, he saw him suddenly hand off the drive to somebody passing by, clearly unaware that Marco saw it. He quickly approached the guy he saw take the USB and snatched it out of his hands before fleeing the scene. That ordeal was finally over, he thought, and they could go back to examining the drive. However, as he was approaching Glenn, he took one more look at the drive and realized that it was missing the red etching of the Rising Phoenix logo on it - it was a decoy.\n“NO!” Marco yelled out as he realized.\n“What, what?” Glenn asked.\n“It’s a decoy…I lost the drive!” Marco cried out as he sat down on a nearby chair.\n“Hey, hey…calm down! I was gonna tell you about this, but I put a tracker program on that drive a while ago…!”\n“Wait, what? Why didn’t you tell me?!”\n“I tried to, but you ran off before you heard me!”\n\n“Alright…how do I track it down…?” Marco asked.\n“Use this,” Glenn explained as he gave Marco a small device with a radar screen on it. There was a green dot on it that was in the direction of the dance floor.\n“Every few seconds the dot’s position will update. Just follow it and when it’s right in the middle, that’s when you’ve found the drive,” he explained.\n“Ok…thank you, Glenn. Thank you,” Marco said as he took the device and headed back into the dance floor. Meanwhile, the guy who took the drive was starting to get lost in the sea of people himself. Overclock was still waiting for the drive to be delivered to him, whereas Voltage and her fighters were outside trying to frame Obsidian for smuggling alcohol inside and getting too drunk. As Marco waded through the people, the green dot began to move closer to him, indicating that he was within range.\n\nAt that point, the emcee announced that they would be playing a romantic song, so the couples in the crowd began to hold hands and form space around each other. Marco carefully maneuvered around them so as not to cause trouble, still following the tracking device. The thief spotted Marco coming towards him and panicked - and for good reason. Marco looked up and made direct eye contact with the thief. Immediately, he tried to run away from Marco but was blocked by a bunch of people. Marco put the tracking device in his pocket and gained on him, eventually grabbing him by the wrist. The thief tried to grab Marco back, but he managed to catch it with his other hand. The two of them remained like this for a while, trying to out-strength the other while desperately trying not to cause a commotion. What confused Marco was that the thief kept trying to step backwards instead of trying to push him like he thought. Marco briefly managed to push the thief’s hand away and took out his tracking device - but the green dot wasn’t in the middle.\n\nAfter this realization, the thief broke free from Marco’s grip and ran away. He knew what happened - the drive was now in someone else’s hands. Marco turned around and began following the direction of the green dot once more. He followed…and followed…and followed. Then he reached the drive. He looked up and saw Darren staring at him, confused.\n“Is something wrong, Marco…?” he asked.\n“Darren…you have the drive,” Marco clarified as he confirmed it on the tracking device.\n“What? How?”\n“Somebody must’ve slipped it onto you…can I pat you down?” Marco asked Darren, which he gladly agreed to.\n“Woah…okay…” Darren said as Marco frisked him. Eventually, Marco patted Darren’s outer suit pocket and felt something hard and drive-sized. He took it out and, sure enough, it was the drive - not a decoy.\n\n\tBefore Marco could grab it, however, another thief took it out of Darren’s suit pocket. In a moment that felt like slow motion to him, Marco locked onto the drive and took it out of the guy’s hand before he could get a good grip on it. However, doing this made him lose balance and nearly fall face-first to the ground. Luckily, Darren managed to catch him by his free hand. He then pulled Marco up with all his might, accidentally making him land onto his chest.\n\t“Umph!” Darren let out as Marco made impact. He quickly got off Darren, who was still holding Marco’s hand even though he regained balance already. They both giggled nervously to themselves as Marco looked at the drive in his hand.\n\nMeanwhile, Ramone was still looking around for the drive. They ended up noticing Glenn slowly working on a laptop under the table, so they quickly approached him. They noticed the decoy drive on the table as well and assumed that was it. After reaching the table, they swiftly snatched the drive and looked at it. Seeing the lack of red etching, however, made them realize it was a fake. They turned to Glenn and saw him looking at them groggily, trying to process that who he was seeing was Ramone.\n“Where is he?” Ramone asked sternly to the dumbfounded Glenn, who still hadn’t said a word to them. His eyes darted to the dance floor for a split second, which gave Ramone all the information they needed.\n“Thank you,” they said as they headed straight there, pocketing the decoy drive.\n\n\tIn the crowd, Marco saw someone else who looked like they were looking around for the drive, which he was still gripping tightly in his other hand. He quickly moved behind Darren to stay out of view, with Darren still holding his free hand. \n\t“Darren…I know this sounds crazy, but we’re going to have to dance our way out of here,” Marco told him, which lit up Darren’s face.\n\t“This is like Grade 8 PE all over again,” Darren quipped.\n\tSuddenly, another person tried taking the drive, but Marco simply stepped to the side of Darren and pushed them away. As the music began to get louder, the crowd started to get rowdier, which was making it difficult to leave. Suddenly, Marco tripped trying to get out, but Darren managed to pull him back up. The way he pulled him up, however, actually spun him to the other side. As the two tried to figure a way out, Ramone saw them both.\n\n\t“Sorry, scratch what I said, I think I should leave alone,” Marco explained to Darren.\n\t“No no, I can help you!” Darren pleaded.\n\t“Listen,” Marco explained as he showed the drive to Darren with two fingers holding it, “...this drive is the most important thing right now, and I can*not* let - ”\n\tAt that moment, Marco saw something that horrified him. It was a playing card, which flew straight into the drive, knocking it out of his hand. Ramone was there. The drive quickly fell on the floor straight after.\n\t“NO!” Marco shouted as he tried fishing around for the drive, but another thief picked it up a few seconds later. Ramone then walked straight into the thief, bumped them, and swapped the real drive with the decoy. Marco tried to keep up with who to follow, but he could still feel Darren tugging on his hand.\n\n\tMarco looked around and saw a few people staring at them - judgingly. That is what sent him over the edge.\n\t“I CAN’T DO THIS RIGHT NOW!” Marco yelled out at Darren, which caused even more heads to turn. Darren’s expression instantly turned sullen.\n\t“I’m sorry…” he said as he let go of Marco’s hand and walked away, heartbroken. Marco took a few deep breaths as he watched Darren disappear into the crowd, feeling like he did something wrong. He brushed it off and continued to go after Ramone, who was approaching another table with a girl sitting by herself. Marco quickly maneuvered around the tables and chairs towards Ramone, who was unaware that Marco was approaching. Suddenly, they felt a hand grab their suit. They turned around and saw Marco staring right into their soul. They quickly pulled out their remaining playing cards out of self-defense.\n\n\t“Give me the drive,” Marco told Ramone with pure conviction.\n\t“I didn’t get my money,” Ramone argued as their eyes darted towards the girl on the table, which Marco noticed.\n\t“Who is she…?”\n\t“Hazel’s not involved with this. Leave her out of it!”\n\t“Not until that drive is mine.” \n\tThey looked towards the drive, which was deep in their suit pocket, and back at Hazel a few times before they made their decision.\n\t“I’ll give you the drive…just don’t bother us anymore, please,” Ramone said as they stared at Hazel, who was beginning to notice what was happening, leaving Marco surprised. They took the drive out of their suit pocket and placed it firmly in Marco’s hand, also giving some of their playing cards as well to keep.\n\t“You got what you wanted, Marco. Just…promise you’ll take them down for me.”\n\t\n\tWith that, Ramone walked away from Marco. He looked at the tracker and the drive itself, confirming it was the real deal. Marco stuffed the drive and Ramone’s cards in his suit pockets and began making his way back to Glenn’s table with a sense of accomplishment. Brianna, who had just been at her seat this whole time, saw Marco walking back to his table grinning from ear to ear. This piqued her interest, so she made her way over there as well.\n\t“I got it back…” Marco told Glenn. After getting no response, he looked closer at him and realized he was completely asleep.\n\t“Hey…!” Marco said as he tried shaking Glenn awake, but he quickly fell back asleep again. Marco could only sigh in frustration.\n\n\t“What happened…?” Brianna asked as she approached talking distance.\n\t“Long story…” Marco told her as he patted the suit pocket with the drive in it.\n\t“Can I see?” she asked in an innocuous tone.\n\t“No.”\n\t“What?”\n\t“I got this. Not you,” Marco told her bluntly. This made her upset, but she continued asking about what went down.\n\n\tFor the rest of the prom, Marco stayed in his seat and kept the drive right in his suit pocket, only getting up for the dinner service and the bathroom. After Glenn finally woke up a couple hours before the prom ended, they agreed that they wouldn’t open the drive in the prom itself so that Glenn could bring it home and examine it there. Marco also saw Ramone and Hazel dancing together, which stood in stark contrast to what happened with him and Darren, who took the seat opposite Marco to avoid looking at him. Marco soon came up with a secluded meeting place in Pisay for the Dexterous Detectives to go to finally destroy S.P.E.C.T.R.E. - once and for all. \n\nAfter a fun prom night came to a close and Glenn was about to get in his car, Marco gave the drive to him and sent him on his way.\n\nAs Glenn’s car drove away, Marco knew - this was the beginning of the end.\n\n"

    "content": "It was 3AM; Marco stared at the ceiling of his bedroom, unable to sleep. After prom ended, he was promptly picked up and brought back home by his mom. He had laid in bed three hours earlier, but he was still twisting and turning on his mattress, unable to shoo away the thought of what would happen the next day. He turned to the side once more, clutching his pillow and shutting his eyes as tightly as possible to gain even the tiniest hope of falling asleep right then. Thankfully, a few minutes later he was successful - prom night was officially over.\n\n*Ring, ring!*\n\t*Ring, ring!*\n\t*Ring, ring!*\n\t*Ring, ring!*\n\t*Ring - *\n\n\tMarco slowly reached for his nightstand and turned off his phone alarm. The next day had come about. He sat upright and looked at his phone, noticing that he had received an email just a few minutes before. He opened it and was surprised by what he saw. It was an angry email by Sir Ernest that was addressed to every student that attended the prom, which consisted of a vitriolic rant calling them irresponsible and a disgrace to the country. Attached were several pictures of the 2nd floor of the Tiago Rodriguez Ballroom, showing flipped tables, shattered plates and glasses, and the crack Overclock left on the balcony railing. Marco knew he was going to get chewed out by Sir Ernest for this.\n\n\tAs Marco went through his daily routine, he felt a strange sense of inner peace. Things he would normally go through without a second thought like taking a bath, eating breakfast, and changing his clothes, all felt refreshing to him. After dressing up, Marco checked his phone one last time, seeing a new message from Glenn. In it, he told Marco that he did leave the drive decrypting overnight and that it had finally finished. He was on his way with the laptop and the drive to come in range of the Pisay servers and finally terminate S.P.E.C.T.R.E. This was the day they would access the drive, Marco realized. This is the day they would win.\n\n\tAs he left his house and got on the school bus, he couldn’t help but feel anxious about the whole thing. What if the drive was another fake? What if they were unable to get inside S.P.E.C.T.R.E.? What if S.P.E.C.T.R.E. already activated? These questions grew louder and louder in his mind the closer the bus got to Pisay. He could feel his heartbeat racing as he saw the bus enter Miriam Defensor-Santiago Road. He put his hand on his chest and took some deep breaths, which helped calm him down a bit. He got off the bus as soon as it reached the drop-off, ready to make the short walk to their agreed meeting place - the back of the gym.\n\n As he traversed the sidewalks leading to it, his heart rate began to climb once more. He walked up the stairs and to the right side of the pool, aiming to take the back entrance to the gym. Internally, he was praying no one would be there to ask questions. He was subsequently relieved when his wishes were proven true. He climbed up the stairs, up to the stage, and to the back of the gym. There he found Glenn and Brianna sitting down around Glenn’s laptop, with Prairie entering right at the same time. This was it, he thought. He made it.\n“Right on time,” Glenn said excitedly, “Get over here.”\n\nMarco hurriedly ran over and sat in front of the laptop. Glenn pulled out the drive and held it up in front of everyone.\n“Do it,” Marco told him as he nodded. Glenn plugged the drive in, bringing up a bunch of terminals with intimidating looking text.\n“Give me a moment…” Glenn said as he got straight to work hacking back into the Pisay servers. Marco, Prairie, and Brianna watched in amazement as Glenn coded up a storm, his hands almost gliding above the keyboard as he typed things they couldn’t possibly understand. However, he suddenly stopped typing.\n“Hold on…” he told them all. Marco feared the worst.\n\nGlenn then pulled out his phone and began Googling a snippet of code he forgot parts of.\n“Seriously?” Marco asked, gobsmacked.\n“What? I don’t know everything. What do you think I am?” Glenn fired back.\nAfter that slight detour, Glenn got into Pisay’s servers just a few moments later. \n“So what are you going to do now…?” Brianna asked anxiously.\n“I need to trace S.P.E.C.T.R.E., find out where it’s gone…” Glenn explained as he continued to code up a storm. A series of points began to appear on screen as more and more infected devices were identified. The server addresses were being spit out on a terminal off to the side - Glenn took a look at it and realized something grave.\n\t“These aren’t just Pisay servers…” Glenn remarked,\n\n\t“These are from the *entire* government.”\n\n\t“...what…?” Marco said calmly in pure disbelief.\n\t“I had my SIP at DOST, they showed us around their servers. Their servers are connected to the other government databases and…S.P.E.C.T.R.E. must’ve infected them too,” Glenn slowly explained. \n\t“That’s DepEd…DTI…DOH…” Glenn said as he pointed at the server addresses on screen. Marco stood up and took a few steps back, attempting to process the heightened stakes. \n\t“DPWH…DTI…DOJ…” Glenn continued, his voice beginning to crack.\nIf S.P.E.C.T.R.E. activates, the entire Philippines would grind to a halt, Marco realized. Hundreds of thousands of records of millions of Filipinos - all erased. The reality of the situation began to dawn on Prairie and Brianna as well.\n\n“Anong gagawin natin?” Prairie asked, “Kailangan natin i-report 'to, di 'ba? Gobyerno yan!”\n“NO!” Marco yelled out, “There’s no time! It could be activating in a few minutes for all we know! If we report this now, we’ll be wasting valuable time!”\n“Bakit? Paano kung lumala pa 'to dahil sa 'tin? Bakit hindi ipasa na lang natin 'to sa mga eksperto?”\n“We *are* qualified! We’re the only ones who can stop this right now…and even if we aren’t…we have to do it or die trying.”\n“He’s right,” Glenn interjected, “We have to do something now. We can do something…I can do something.”\nGlenn then began to map out the routes to the other Pisay servers contained on the drive to see if the Rising Phoenix infected them too. The routes consisted of the server addresses and the computers along the shortest path, which S.P.E.C.T.R.E. had to infect to reach the servers themselves.\n“Don’t worry guys,” Glenn reassured them, “I’m going to make a stop signal that should propagate through S.P.E.C.T.R.E. very quickly. It should be fairly straightforward…just watch my back for me.”\n\n\t“Alright,” Marco agreed, recognizing how important this was going to be.\n\t“Brianna, watch the left corridor…Prairie, watch the right one…I’ll watch the door. Tell us if you see anything suspicious!” he ordered with utter conviction as he moved into position. Both of them quickly moved into position as well.\n\t“Pasensya na, pero pwede ba ako tumae muna? Ganito talaga ako kapag nababalisa ako,” Prairie explained nervously as she got up. This request quickly triggered Marco’s ire, especially since she said it in a way that made Marco suspicious.\n\t“The Rising Phoenix could be looking for us right now, it’s too dangerous! Can’t you stay?!” Marco asked, clearly annoyed and distrusting of her.\n\t“Pwede ba? Hindi ko na kayang pigilin 'to...”\n\t“I’ll accompany her,” Brianna offered, noticing that Marco was afraid Prairie would be up to no good.\n\t“Fine,” Marco agreed reluctantly, “But be quick!”\n\n\tPrairie got up and went to the bathroom with Brianna following behind, all while Marco stared daggers at her. After they were both out of sight, he redirected his attention back towards Glenn, who was working on the stop signal.\n\t“I’m surprised you let them go…” Glenn remarked as he continued typing.\n\t“Just keep working, no time for small talk…” Marco ordered, which ended their conversation on the spot. Suddenly, Marco heard a faint sound coming from somewhere behind the door.\n\t“”What was that…?” Marco asked as he immediately stood up. His heart was beating out of his chest. His instincts were telling him that someone was coming. \n\t“It won’t break anything if you take the drive out now, right…?” Marco asked as he looked around frantically.\n\t“Technically, no. Why…?” Glenn confusedly asked. Marco suddenly bent down and took out the drive. \n\n\t“What are you doing?!” Glenn blurted out as Marco began stuffing it inside his shoe.\n\t“Someone’s coming…” Marco told him worryingly.\n\t“I need that to access S.P.E.C.T.R.E.! Give that back right now - ”\n\tThey both fell silent as they clearly heard another sound - the sound of a few footsteps approaching from behind the door. Seconds passed by as the pair realized what was happening. Glenn quickly began packing up his laptop as Marco thought of what he should do. Suddenly, the door opened a notch - and a single green smoke grenade flew through the air and landed beside them before the door was quickly shut.\n\t“RUN!” Marco shouted out as he shoved Glenn out of the way and put his body on top of the smoke grenade. After a few seconds, it exploded, enveloping Marco in a thick green fog. He coughed and wheezed as he breathed in the gas. Soon, he began to feel sleepy - very, *very* sleepy. In his last waking moments, he looked up and saw Glenn running out as fast as he could.\n\n\n\tHe then fell to the ground, unconscious. The Rising Phoenix got him.\n\n\n\tMarco woke up. He looked down and found himself bound tightly to a chair, with rope on his arms and legs and duct tape on his mouth. He looked around and realized he was surrounded by other Rising Phoenix members he hadn't seen before, all standing ominously around him in a circular formation. The place he was in was incredibly dark, only being lit up by a flickering incandescent bulb and the sunlight peeking out from under the walls, which were made of corrugated metal. It was then that he realized he was in the temporary shed built beside the gym for construction purposes. \n\nHe suddenly felt movement behind him - someone else was tied up in a chair as well back-to-back with Marco. The voice Marco heard through the duct tape made him realize that it was Prairie, who was hopelessly struggling to get out of her restraints. It was at this moment when Marco truly began to fear for his life. He began to tear up, wondering if this was where he would die. Before he could do so, the door to the shed opened. Marco was unable to see who entered since it was on his left, much to his frustration.\n\n\t“Hello, Marco…” a person called out. Marco froze - he realized that this was a familiar voice.\n\t“You want to know who’s *really* in control? Who’s *really* pulling the strings? Well…here I am.”\n\tThey slowly walked in front of Marco and looked down at him. He looked right back and was devastated to see who was staring at him, wearing the signature red bird mask and the black coat Obsidian once donned.\n\n\nIt was Brianna.\n\n*She* was the true leader.\n\n\n\t"

    "content": "Marco shook his head, utterly defeated by what he had just learned. A moment of silence followed as pure rage began to well up in Marco. Brianna reached over and ripped the tape off Marco’s mouth to let him talk.\n“I HATE YOU!” Marco screamed as loud as he could at Brianna, who remained motionless. He tried to break out of his restraints once more, trying to lunge at her. As he failed to get out, Brianna began to laugh in amusement.\n“Where's Glenn…?!” Marco asked through gritted teeth as he looked around and realized he didn't know his whereabouts.\n“He’s…somewhere else, I’ll say,” Brianna told him, “I’m surprised how far he got, honestly. He ran like hell.”\n\n“Let…me…GO!” Marco yelled out in frustration.\n“You know, it's funny…” Brianna mocked as she stood in front of him, “...you just led us to the one thing we needed to complete our plan - the server addresses of the other campuses. And you played right into our hands *every* time,” Brianna said as she leaned in towards Marco as he struggled.\n“You had every chance to figure out it was me but you *didn’t*. You were so blinded by your mission, your utter determination to prevent real change from happening - that you never realized *I* was your enemy all along,” she continued.\n\n“Think about it…way back when you infiltrated that meeting in the electrical room…*I* was the one who pointed you there. Did you honestly think we meet there and leave the door open for no reason?” she asked Marco as she began to laugh once more. As he looked back at that moment, Marco questioned how he hadn’t realized that.\n“And when you were chasing one of my fighters on the go-kart…? I was never beaten. I didn’t even have a scratch on me,” Brianna told him, referring to the moment Marco saw Obsidian run out of the forest without Brianna. Soon, her mind flashed back to that very moment.\n\n*…She quickly began making her way to the giant cotton tree in the middle of the forest. Walking slowly, she looked behind the tree and was surprised to find nobody behind it. Suddenly, someone grabbed her by the arm…*\nBrianna nearly fell over as Obsidian dragged her behind the tree.\n“HEY!” she yelled out, irritated that he had tugged so hard.\n“Sorry, Bri…I don’t know what to do from here…” Obsidian explained apologetically. He tried to dust her off, but she swatted his hand away.\n“Keep the illusion going. I’ll stay here and you run out…make it look like you defeated me. Do it *now*!” she ordered as she heard the go-kart getting closer. Obsidian promptly obeyed and ran out of the forest, which is what Marco saw.\n\n“And that deal at the 4th Floor auditorium? *I* was the voice at the other end of your recording device,” Brianna revealed, which brought back Marco’s memory of the ominous words he heard on the other end - *we’re everywhere.*\n“I jumped in just at the right time…to make myself the hero of the fight. To make you trust me even more. And you fell for it.”\nAs she said this, her mind harkened back to the events of the fight.\n\n*…“Brianna…?!” Marco yelled out.\nBefore she could respond, she made her way through the divider, with Celsius and Fahrenheit targeting her instead. The divider slammed shut as Voltage slowly got back up, staring at Marco with pure anger behind her eyes…*\n\tOut of Marco’s sight, Brianna held up her hand towards Celsius and Fahrenheit.\n“Why are you here?” Celsius asked.\n“I’m gaining his trust. I can feel him shutting me out of the investigation. This will make him keep me in his inner circle,” Brianna explained. All three of them stood around as they listened to Marco and Voltage fight on the other side. After a few seconds, Brianna walked up to the divider.\n“I have to make him believe we fought here,” she said as she slammed the divider wall with her fist. She then slapped herself hard on the cheek to make it seem like she sustained damage.\n“When Voltage tells you to go, you go, OK?” she told Celsius and Fahrenheit as she laid down on the ground. The two looked at each other in confusion, but agreed to the plan regardless. Soon after, Voltage opened the divider, and they both retreated with her as instructed.\n\n By now, it was beginning to dawn on Marco how little he really knew about Brianna.\n“I could go on and on, but you get the point,” Brianna told him, “Aside from those two idiots meeting in the library, I planned *everything*. When we stole those perio papers way back then, we knew what they were going to do next - go digital. And now, we're primed to achieve *maximum* damage.” \nMarco realized she was right, recalling how he took his perios on tablets and heard a worker take out papers from the Records Room. It all made sense. Silence followed as Marco took in all of this information.\n“Why…why would you do this…?” he asked, feeling utterly hopeless and defeated. Brianna looked down and scoffed.\n“The real question is why didn’t I do this earlier,” she fired back.\nBrianna walked over to Prairie’s side, looking at her before looking back at Marco.\n“She doesn’t know, does she…?” Brianna asked. Marco refused to answer, which she took as a sign she was right. She took a deep breath before beginning to explain her storied past.\n\n“I was born out of wedlock,” she recounted.\n“I started life as the black sheep. The scapegoat. A burden everyone had to put up with…and it’s never changed. My parents…my classmates…everyone else. They all treated me the same - like the dirt beneath their feet. My elementary classmates had a habit of…singling me out. And they would make it known. *Very* known. I’d come home with bruises and *no one* cared. That’s why I learned self-defense…I had to fight back,” she explained as she walked in front of Marco.\n\n“My only refuge was my textbooks. They were my only friends. I studied *relentlessly*…and eventually, I managed to claw my way to the top. People started to respect me…and the beatings got less frequent. Then I decided to take this little exam called the NCE on a whim. I wasn’t expecting anything. But when the results came in? I did it. I was overjoyed…my efforts were finally recognized, and most of all, I thought my parents would finally be proud of me. But…I was wrong,” she said as her mind flashed back to that very moment.\n\n*Brianna peeked around the corner, seeing that her parents were watching TV on their worn-down couch. She slowly walked up to them, clutching the day’s newspaper in her hand.*\n“Mama? Papa?” she called out to them. \nShe walked up to them and showed them the newspaper, with the NCE results right there. Her name was circled in red marker.\n“Nakapasa ako sa NCE…!” she said, squealing with joy. However, her parents continued watching TV regardless.\n“OK,” her mom told her nonchalantly.\n“Edi dun ka mag-aaral. Mamaya na natin pag-usapan 'to,” her dad followed as he switched the channel. Neither of them even glanced at her. The smile slowly melted off Brianna’s face as she realized they still didn’t care.\nShe dejectedly walked back to her room, choosing to forget her parents’ reaction and focus on her success in getting in.\n\nMarco and Prairie sat in silence, feeling pitiful for Brianna. They slowly began to understand her motives.\n“I thought things would get better after I got into Pisay, that I could *finally* be someone…I did stop worrying about my safety, but then the worst came to pass. My victory was a fluke. Every quarter, I would come just short of treses and quatros - and my parents were *not* happy. And my social life wasn’t any better. I became invisible. Every time I tried to reach out to someone…I’d end up pushing them away. I *hated* myself…and I still do,” Brianna continued.\n\n“But my final straw came in 4th Quarter,” she explained further.\n“I discovered something about myself that…scared me. I felt ashamed. I tried to push it down. I tried to cure myself…but nothing worked. I realized that I couldn’t change it - I had to live with this now. It didn’t help my feeling of not belonging anywhere. The world wanted me to choose…but I couldn’t. What made it worse was that there was this…girl I used to talk to. Her name was Hazel. And one day…we did something…reckless,” she said as she recalled another moment from the past.\n\n*Brianna was alone in one of the IS Labs, only accompanied by Hazel. They were left cleaning up the mess from a previous experiment. The two of them had barely talked since after everyone had already left.*\n“This sucks…” Brianna muttered as she wiped experiment residue off one of the wooden tables. She looked over at Hazel, who sat a few feet away.\n“Hazel, are you done?” she asked.\n“Yeah…” she told Brianna, “I just wanted to ask you something.”\n“What is it?” she asked, perking up.\n“I’ve kinda speculated on this for a while, but…are you, you know?” Hazel asked, making it very clear what she was implying. Brianna instantly blushed upon hearing this.\n“Oh, wow…well, not entirely, if you know what I mean…” she replied, “...why?”\n“Bri…” Hazel asked her, “...what are we…?”\n\nBrianna stopped sweeping. She didn’t know how to answer her.\n“I don’t know…” she told Hazel.\n“I’m scared…I don’t know what everyone else will think. You do…feel the same way, right?” Hazel asked nervously.\n“...I do,” Brianna told her. Hazel blushed in kind. Brianna slowly walked up to her, ending up just inches away from her face. She was slightly nervous pulling such a brave maneuver. Hazel, on the other hand, was freaking out on the inside.\n“Why don’t we try something…new?” Brianna asked as she confidently leaned closer. Hazel reciprocated, and they began inching ever closer to one another.\nBut from the corner of her eye, Brianna saw something that made her heart drop.\nIt was Sir Ernest, watching from the window. He saw the whole thing.\n\n“I remember that day like it was yesterday,” Brianna explained, “...he immediately reported both of us to the D.O., and…they told my parents. They were angry. Very, *very* angry. They couldn’t understand it. From that day forward, I was nothing but the devil to them. An evil presence that needed to be eliminated. And that’s when I couldn’t take it anymore. My entire existence has been nothing but pain and agony. I’d been kicked down over and over and over.”\n\n“And when you’re kicked down…it’s hard not to kick back.”\n\nWith that, Brianna’s story came to an end. The whole room fell silent for what felt like an eternity. Marco knew parts of her story - but now knowing the full picture, it finally began to dawn on him how ignorant he was. After a few seconds, Brianna walked in front of him and spoke once more.\n“You were the only person whose friendship I’ve managed to maintain in my whole life,” Brianna revealed to him. She was right, Marco thought - he’d never seen her hang out with anyone else before.\n“When I met you, it seemed like you actually cared about me. But I’ve noticed that over the years, you seem to care more and more about yourself. Your grades. Your self-image. And I…didn’t fit in it - not unusual for me. You don’t have to tell me. And with you trying so hard to take down the Rising Phoenix - my greatest creation, the product of my blood, sweat, and tears - all while pushing me away? *That* was it for me.”\nBrianna knelt down and got to Marco’s eye level.\n\n“Now? I’d kill you if I had to. And I would relish it. Every single second.” \n\nSuddenly, Marco heard someone else enter the shed. Whoever it was seemed to be carrying a cane - the same one from the 4th Floor Audi - as he could hear it tapping on the wooden floor. Brianna immediately stood up and approached them.\n“Alani,” Brianna said as she hugged her tightly, “I’ve been waiting for you, my love…”\nMarco was confused. He wasn’t aware of any Alani in the batch.\n“My cane,” Brianna said as she took it from her and used it.\n“The coat, please…” Alani requested as she pointed at Brianna’s coat, which she reluctantly gave, thinking it reduced her intimidation factor. Alani proceeded to cover up her body with it while putting on her black mask.\nThe pair then walked in front of Marco, allowing him to see who it was. Marco was shocked. The one he’d been hunting up until now - Obsidian - was Brianna’s lover. As Alani put a blue, pink, and white colored clip-on bow in her hair, the realization slowly dawned on Marco.\n\n“The world was against us both. Grade 8 was when we decided to fight back…we agreed to make our dreams reality. An organization that would stand up - and eventually destroy - Pisay itself. She was the only one with the initiative to do something about it. I’m so glad we found each other,” Brianna explained as she lifted her hand to caress Alani’s cheek. She, however, moved her head out of the way. Brianna tried again, but she did the same thing.\n\n“Is something wrong, babe…?” she asked in a calm manner that masked anger building within.\n“Why did you tie them so tightly…? Look at them…!” Alani asked angrily as she motioned towards Marco and Prairie.\n“Since when did I allow you to get sympathetic for these…wastes of life?” Brianna asked as she tilted her head. She was clearly growing angrier by the second.\n“We didn’t *have* to do this…! We have them surrounded, it doesn’t matter…!”\n“Babe, I don’t care if it matters or not. I’m doing this to prove a point!”\n“What point?! That we’re barbarians…?” Alani asked, tears beginning to well up in her eyes.\n“We are *not* barbarians! Everything we do is for the greater good! How do you still not understand that?! Maybe you’re just ungrateful!” Brianna countered as she lifted her cane towards her.\n\n“Ungrateful? I did all your dirty work for you! The recruiting…the crimes…posing as the true leader…! That was *me*, not you! I *made* you! You’re the ungrateful one!”\nBrianna walked closer to her, barely holding back anger at what she said.\n“For the thousandth time, you did *not* make me! I’m the one keeping this whole thing together! You listen to *me*! That’s the order of power here. I don’t care how you feel about that!”\n“You don’t care how I feel about anything!”\n\n“You know what? I’m leaving you, Alani! And I’m *never* coming back!”\n“No, no - wait! Please, stay!” Alani begged as she hugged Brianna as tight as she could, stopping her from walking to the door.\n“Stay with me, please…I need you…I love you…I love you,” she said over and over as tears escaped from her eyes, with Brianna staring listlessly out of her sight. Marco couldn’t believe what he was witnessing. This couldn’t be love, he thought.\n\n\tAlani knelt down and cried, with Brianna continuing to show no emotion. After a minute, she wiped her tears away and stood back up. She walked up to the corner of the room, getting herself out of Brianna’s way. She put the cane back on the ground before starting her spiel.\n\t“Don’t you realize, Marco? We didn’t do all of this for no reason; we were pushed to this point. *All* of us,” Brianna explained.\n\t“Pisay tricked me. Same as Alani. They made us believe we could trust them…but we shouldn’t have. So we started the Rising Phoenix…to stand up for those who couldn’t.”\n\t“Voltage was a star student before coming to Pisay. She got whittled down by the stress and hecticness of her new environment - to the point where she became a husk of herself. She had no more purpose, no outlet for her talents in electronics. Then we found her.”\n\t“Overclock used to compete for Pisay abroad in math compets. Then Pisay implicated his whole team for cheating in a compet - even though he had no idea what they were doing. He was never allowed to compete again, and he was left with nothing to do. Then we found him.”\n\t\n\t“That was him…?” Marco asked, remembering that scandal from a few years ago.\n\t“Yes, he was part of it. And them…?” Brianna said as she looked at the Rising Phoenix members standing all around them, “...they’re some new recruits from this past year. Grade 8, Grade 9…they’re actually pretty good at what they do. And like us, they were wronged by Pisay. But then…*we found them*.”\n\tMarco couldn’t help but feel disgusted. She was indeed manipulating lower years into joining her cause.\n\t“You should be ashamed of yourself, Bri. This has gone *too* far!” Marco called out to her.\n\t“You don’t get to call me that anymore, Marco. Not after you abandoned me as my only friend!”\n\t“What, is that it? The entirety of Pisay has to pay for *your* pain? *Your* anger?!”\n\t“Yes! They do, Marco! They do.”\n\t\n\t“It’s not just Pisay either! We looked through S.P.E.C.T.R.E. It’s infiltrated *government* servers! You are committing *treason*! You’ll go to *jail* if this thing goes off!” Marco angrily explained.\n\t“I know, Marco. I just don’t care,” Brianna told him.\n\t“WHAT?!”\n\t“If there’s collateral damage…it may be the only way to get them to listen.”\n\t“Are you insane?! You can’t just put a torch to everything! What is wrong with you?!” Marco yelled out, shaking the chair he was tied to.\n\n“I’d be *glad* to burn it all, Marco. First Pisay, then the world. But even then…*the world is not enough.*”\n\n\t“Are you hearing yourself? You don’t get to decide everyone else’s fate, Brianna!” Marco yelled, “I’ve had it bad too! I don’t even have a dad anymore…do you know how it feels? At least yours is still alive! I don’t go around making everyone else pay for it…unlike you!”\n\t“*My* father thinks I shouldn’t be allowed to live…!” she yelled back as she pointed her cane at him, “I might as well not exist to my parents. I’m unwanted! I’ve always *been* unwanted! Don’t you understand?! Do you know how painful that is?!”\n\tAt that moment, the two of them ran out of breath from yelling at each other. A strangely peaceful silence soon filled the entire room. It lasted for some time, with the Rising Phoenix recruits and Alani watching it all unfold.\n\t“You betrayed me…” Marco muttered.\n\t“Then you shouldn’t have trusted me to begin with,” Brianna replied.\n\n\tMore silence followed as Marco hung his head in defeat. Brianna put her cane on the ground and started talking once more.\n\t“There’s no point trying. You can’t stop us anymore…” Brianna told him, “In a few minutes, everything will *finally* come to an end.”\n\tShe went to a nearby table with a laptop placed on top and began to dragged it in front of Marco. She swiped lightly on the mousepad, which brought the screen back to life. She used the end of her cane to lift up Marco’s chin. On the screen, he saw something that made his heart drop. It was a timer titled *S.P.E.C.T.R.E. ACTIVATION*, and it showed 19 minutes, 5 seconds, and 230 milliseconds on the clock.\n\t“Now you can witness the fruits of your labor,” she said mockingly as the timer counted down before him.\n\n\t“Before I go, there’s *one* last loose end I need to tie up…” Brianna explained as she gave her cane to one of the recruits and grabbed something else in return. She then knelt down in front of Marco and held it in front of his face. It was Voltage’s taser, the same one she used in the 4th Floor Audi and at prom.\n\t“She made herself a better version, so I get to use this…” she explained as she pressed the button to turn it on, producing a visible electric arc between its prongs.\n\t“Now, tell me…where is the drive? *Your* drive.”\n\tMarco sat there, terrified. He knew the drive was still hidden inside his shoe. He stayed silent, not wanting to help Brianna. After a few seconds, she grew impatient.\n\n\t“Don’t want to talk? Very well…”\n\tSuddenly, she jammed the end of the taser into Marco’s side, electrocuting him. He let out a bloodcurdling scream as the shock continued to course through his body. Prairie wished she could cover her ears, but all she could do was grin and bear the agonizing screams. Alani looked away, unable to watch. All the while, Brianna remained numb and focused. After a few seconds, she took the taser off Marco.\n\t“Let’s try this again…” Brianna told Marco as he coughed and wheezed forcibly, “...where is the drive…?”\n\t“I don’t know…I left it with Glenn! I don’t know where he put it, he must’ve tossed it!” Marco said convincingly enough.\n\n\t“That makes sense,” Brianna told him. \nMarco felt some relief, as it seemed Brianna bought that explanation. Suddenly, she plunged the taser back into him. His screams reverberated through the room. The Rising Phoenix recruits stood there emotionless as Prairie began to tear up from what was happening. Marco could feel the pain beginning to bring him to the point of unconsciousness, and he was ready to give in. Just then, Alani interrupted.\n\t“Bri…” he told her, “...we’re running out of time. Maybe we should do the speech now.”\n\tBrianna slowly took the taser off Marco and gave it to a nearby recruit. \n\t“Alright…” she replied, “...we don’t need the drive anyway. We have our own.”\n\tBrianna looked back at Marco, who was looking down at the ground, gasping for air.\n\t“If you still have it, we’ll just have to find it off your corpse.”\n\n\tShe stood up and got her cane back before accompanying Alani to the door. Before they left, Brianna had some parting words.\n\t“I’ll be back, you two. I have an…announcement…to make,” she explained as she pulled out what looked like some kind of wired microphone.\n\t“Have fun.”\n\tWith that, she shut the door, leaving Marco and Prairie inside. As Marco watched the timer in front of him hit 17 minutes, his hope had all but evaporated. \n\n\t\n\t\n\tThis was it - the end of Pisay.\n\n\nAnd it was all his fault.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "content": "Upon leaving the shed, Brianna quickly made her way to the grandstand with Alani firmly by her side. She strutted confidently, knowing that her plans were about to come to fruition, while Alani walked timidly with every step.\n\t“Hold my hand, dear…” Brianna told Alani as she held out her hand slightly. Alani, however, ignored her and kept walking onward. Brianna put her hand back down, slightly annoyed.\n\n\tMoments later, the pair made it to the grandstand. They walked up the steps to the top middle seat, overlooking the entire SHB. There, Voltage stood in silence, awaiting their arrival. She carried the Rising Phoenix’s counterpart to Glenn’s laptop in her hands, giving it to Brianna as she sat down with Alani.\n\t“Go back to the BLOB…make sure the rest of them are on patrol,” Brianna ordered Voltage.\n\t“Of course, Phoenix,” Voltage replied, leaving Brianna and Alani by themselves.\n\n\tBrianna started up the laptop, which quickly lit up the screen and activated a series of programs at her disposal. She could now see the countdown to S.P.E.C.T.R.E.’s activation, which had gone down to 16 minutes. The P.O.V.s of every Rising Phoenix recruit in the SHB were laid out, thanks to the tiny cameras embedded into their masks. \n\t“Radio…” Brianna uttered as she held her hand out to Alani, who paused briefly before digging into her pocket and giving her a small walkie-talkie device. Brianna turned it on and pressed the push-to-talk button to radio in.\n\n\t“Comms check…” she muttered with the walkie-talkie right at her mouth. This prompted everyone on Brianna’s laptop to throw up a discreet thumbs-up gesture in front of themselves, confirming all their earpieces were functional. Brianna radioed in again to check up on Overclock, who was with Wildfire and Heatwave on the roof of the SHB.\n\t“Overclock…how is it over there…?” she asked. Overclock grabbed his walkie-talkie to respond.\n\t“Going well, Phoenix. All the other campuses will be infected soon,” Overclock reported as he had his metal gauntlet against Glenn’s shoulder. Glenn was tied up with his hands behind his back in front of his own laptop, all while Wildfire and Heatwave were having a chat nearby. For convenience, they were using Glenn’s laptop since it already had the paths to the other campus servers on them.\n\t“No need to thank us,” he added.\n\n\t“Thank you for the update. Over,” Brianna replied coldly before radioing out. Lastly, she untangled the wired microphone she was carrying and plugged it into the laptop - with that, her setup was complete. Brianna readjusted her mask and slumped on the grandstand backrest beside Alani.\n\t“The world will never be the same after this, Alani…” Brianna said to her softly. Once again, Alani remained indifferent. Brianna brushed it off and went back to her laptop. She opened a command interface and typed a line into it, which brought up a special program Overclock had created just for her.\n\t“Start P.A. hijack? Y/n”, the program asked. Brianna brought the microphone close to her mouth before assuredly typing in “Y”. She took a deep breath before starting her spiel.\n\t\n\t“Good morning, everyone…” she spoke, her voice echoing throughout the halls of the SHB. Her voice was distorted and pitched down to conceal her identity, which quickly caught people’s attention.\n\t“Today is the beginning of a bright future for Philippine Science High, all thanks to us - the Rising Phoenix.” \nBy now, there were murmurs across the whole campus. Students were opening the doors wide to hear what she was saying. Teachers were stopping to listen. Sir Ernest, who was just outside the Discipline Office, instantly knew something was wrong.\n\n\t“The Rising Phoenix has been operating in the shadows for many years…tipping the scales, righting wrongs…anything we could do to bring justice to all students.”\n\tAs Brianna continued, Sir Ernest ran up the stairs near the FLOB to turn off the P.A. system, his assistant struggling to follow him.\n\t“Philippine Science High School has consistently failed to meet its students’ needs. Time and time again, they have proven that they are more interested in preserving the status quo than changing it - even if it means hurting the very people they claim to serve.”\n\tOn the 2nd Floor, Sir Ernest sprinted down the hall as fast as he could to get to the P.A. room. His assistant couldn’t keep up and instead decided to brisk walk towards him.\n\t\n\t“I know this much…and you all know it as well. The Rising Phoenix has done what no one else is brave enough to do and fought the battle no one wants to fight. The system as we know it is too slow to change - too far gone to be fixed. That is why we need to tear it all down and start over.”\n\tThe entire school was now at a standstill. People listened intently to make sense of the distorted voice. Meanwhile, Sir Ernest finally made it to the P.A. room. However, after twisting the handle a few times, he realized the door was locked. Out of frustration, he slammed his hand on the handle, giving him a slight bruise.\n\t“NASAAN YUNG SUSI?!” he yelled out to his assistant, who had just caught up to him.\n\n\t“And like a phoenix, we will all rise from the ashes to be smarter, better…and most importantly, stronger.”\n\tSir Ernest’s assistant fumbled with her key ring for a few seconds before finding the key to the P.A. room. Sir took it and inserted it into the keyhole, opening the door.\n\t“There may be some difficulties, and not everyone will make it through. But together, we will write our own story. One where we are in control, like it should be. Where no one has to feel helpless, or scared, or alone!”\n\tSir burst into the room, which was filled with wires and broadcasting equipment. He looked around the room as he looked for a way to turn it all off.\n\n\t“Today, the world will know the wrath of the Rising Phoenix.”\n\n\n\tSir Ernest was still looking around when Brianna unplugged her microphone and relinquished control of the P.A. system back to the school. As soon as it ended, everyone who heard it discussed loudly to each other. Their conversations were all filled with a mixture of confusion, bewilderment, and fear from what they had just heard. An IT person had made his way to the P.A. room, only to be stared daggers at by a furious Sir Ernest.\n\t“Makinig ka,” Sir told him, “WALANG aalis dito hangga’t malaman natin kung sinong gumawa nito…!” he yelled out as he held his pointer finger out.\n\t\nBrianna laid down on the backrest, feeling that she had just completed her mission. The countdown to S.P.E.C.T.R.E.’s activation was now at roughly 14 minutes.\n\t“I’m gonna get some fresh air…” Alani told her, visibly nervous about everything that was happening. Brianna paid her no mind and let her leave. Alani quickly shuffled down the grandstand steps before heading back to the shed. She slowly opened the shed door and was greeted to a depressing sight.\n\n\tMarco was completely slouched over, looking like he’d lost all hope. Brianna made sure her speech also played out on the laptop in front of him, just for the sole purpose of gloating. Prairie was similarly distraught, but not as much as Marco seemed to be. Around them both, the new Rising Phoenix recruits stood completely still, as per Brianna’s orders. Alani remembered that these recruits don’t have cameras installed in their masks yet, as the organization was still struggling to find a source for them. In the process, she also remembered her mask’s camera, prompting her to take it off and set it down on a nearby table.\n\n\tAlani slowly walked right in front of Marco, every step slower than the last, before coming to a halt. Seeing him in this condition amongst everything that was happening made her feel unwell.\n\t“Why are you here…?” Marco asked in a grovely, monotone voice, “...come to kick me while I’m down…?”\n\tSuddenly, Alani fell to her knees and started sobbing.\n\t“I can’t do this…” she muttered painfully, her voice barely audible. Confused and surprised, Marco slowly arched his head up to look at her. Prairie also turned her head, caught off-guard by this. There, he saw Alani with tears running down her face, emotionally destroyed. It was then that it clicked for him - she was there to free him and Prairie.\n\n\t“I’m sorry…for everything…I just wanted to feel like I was important…but she was just using me,” Alani told Marco tearfully. He started to feel bad for her, but his guard was still up on the off-chance this was a trick. \n\t“I should’ve stayed away from Bri…I should’ve told Carmen how I felt, I should’ve…” Alani muttered before trailing off. As more tears began to pour, she bowed her head down in shame. Marco started to feel great pity for her; it was clear to him that she was being genuine. The room fell silent, save for Alani’s sobbing - it was as if everything outside the shed ceased to exist, just for a moment.\n\n\t“Maybe…the only purpose…for people like me…is to suffer,” Alani said as she got choked up in her own tears. Marco felt that he had to say something. Not to get her to free him, but to give comfort to someone who desperately needed it.\n\t“No…” Marco uttered, “...maybe, maybe your purpose…and everyone else’s…is to hope,” echoing Darren’s words to him from yesterday. \n\t“How can I hope, Marco…? I can’t…be myself…in a world like this…every time I try…I destroy everything I love…” she told him, still sobbing uncontrollably. Marco paused for a few seconds, thinking of what he could say to her.\n\n\t“Look, Alani…” Marco said to her, “...I know you ended up in the wrong crowd…I think you know that too. Otherwise…you wouldn’t be here. But just know…you’re not alone. Some time…you’ll find your own people. I promise.”\n\tMarco heard Alani’s sobbing gradually slow down, so he kept going.\n\t“But…you’ll never get there if you don’t take that first step. To choose to do the right thing when it matters most…when everyone needs you to.”\n\t“...I can’t…I can’t do it…I’ve done too much…”\n\t“Maybe you have…but we can still fix this, Alani. But you have to believe in yourself first. Only then can you find your happy ending.”\n\n\t“And I’ll tell you now…you’re…a lot stronger than you realize.”\n\n\tAs Marco said that, Alani’s sobbing stopped. After a few seconds passed, she slowly got back up, wiping tears off her face. A new kind of confidence resonated deep within her.\n\t“Everyone, stand down…” she told the Rising Phoenix recruits in the room. She then quickly bent down and untied Marco and Prairie from their chairs. After Alani finished, they both got up and stretched their muscles, raring to stop Brianna’s plans. Marco looked around and found the playing cards Ramone gave him on a nearby table, which had been emptied from his pockets while he was unconscious. He quickly snatched them back.\n\n\n\t“...Let’s do this,” declared Alani.\n\t\n\n"

    "content": "\tMarco, Prairie, and Alani burst out of the shed, ready to put a stop to the Rising Phoenix’s plans. They ran out as fast as they could, but Prairie and Alani slowed down as they saw Marco lagging behind them. He hopped on his left leg as he tried to get his right shoe off, confusing them both. Their confusion was cleared when Marco pulled out the fabled drive, which was still in his shoe the entire time.\n\n\t“How did you sneak that out? We searched you and everything…” Alani asked him, bewildered. Prairie’s face, on the other hand, lit up.\n\t“We need to get this to Glenn’s laptop and terminate S.P.E.C.T.R.E.,” Marco explained frantically, “...Alani, where is it…?” he asked.\n\t“Glenn ran up to the SHB roof…I think he still has it, but there are recruits guarding him…” she informed Marco.\n\t“Good…then that’s where we’re going. We’ll go through the BLOB...it’s faster that way. We have less than 12 minutes left, let’s go…!” Marco called out as he made a straight beeline to the SHB, causing Prairie and Alani to do the same. This was it, Marco thought - the final stretch.\n\n\tMeanwhile, inside the shed, the new recruits were growing restless. They felt like they weren’t supposed to stand around while Marco escaped. \n\t“Guys…! We should tell her…” a nervous recruit whispered.\n\t“Obsidian told us to stand down…! We can’t disobey a direct order!” another recruit whispered back.\n\t“I still think we should say something, just in case…” the nervous recruit replied. After being ignored, he finally got fed up and bit the bullet. He picked up the only walkie-talkie that was left to them and radioed in.\n\n\t“Umm…Phoenix…?” the recruit asked nervously. Brianna was disturbed from her peace and quiet and quickly answered back.\n\t“For the millionth time…if you need to say something important, just…SAY IT!” she yelled out angrily. The other recruits looked at each other, terrified.\n\t“Yeah…um…I don’t know if you saw, but…Obsidian just came in here and untied Marco and that Prairie girl. Just…letting you know,” he told her.\n\tAt that very moment, Brianna watched as Marco, Prairie, and Alani dashed across the field. She sat completely still as she realized what was happening.\n\n\t“...Phoenix…?” the recruit shakily followed up. \n\t“Thank you for telling me. You newbies just stay there, got it?” Brianna ordered calmly. The recruits confirmed the order before radioing out. A few seconds later, Brianna picked up her radio again.\n\t“All units near the BLOB…Marco, Prairie, and Obsidian are heading in your direction. Do NOT let them get to the roof…!” Brianna commanded, her voice conveying the gravity of the situation. Every Rising Phoenix recruit near the area sprung into action, making sure to block the stairs leading to the 2nd Floor. \n\n\n\n\tMeanwhile on the SHB roof, Overclock and his cronies heard Brianna’s orders and were shocked.\n\t“What? Marco escaped…?” Wildfire muttered, to which Overclock smacked him on the shoulder - Glenn was just within earshot. Upon hearing this, a wave of emotions went through Glenn - the situation wasn’t hopeless anymore, he thought. He knew they were coming for him, for the laptop that could stop the Rising Phoenix in their tracks.\n\n\n\n\tBack at the 1st Floor, the trio of Marco, Prairie, and Alani arrived at the BLOB. A few students remained there for their early morning chatter despite the ominous P.A. announcement minutes prior. The trio ran past the corkboards filled with pubmats and flyers and made their way to the stairs. Unfortunately, the Rising Phoenix got there first. The trio backed up as a group of recruits blocked their way and headed towards them. Marco quickly stuffed the drive in his pocket as he looked around. \n\nHe saw recruits closing in from both exit points - they were boxed in. The Rising Phoenix recruits coalesced into one big group as they cornered the trio in front of the uniform shop. As Marco looked at the group in front of them, he realized that they were all people he’d encountered before - Hexane and Octane, still reckless as ever, and Celsius and Fahrenheit, wearing their signature metal plates on their forearms and shins respectively. Most importantly, Voltage stood in the middle - front and center. She was brandishing a new and improved taser, which Marco noticed now had some sort of mechanism that allowed it to shoot out electric prongs. Marco quickly put himself in front of Alani and Prairie in turn.\n\nBrianna watched through her camera feed as the trio stood there, wary of what was to come. She picked the radio up once more.   \n“Voltage, repeat after me…” Brianna told her.\n“Marco. Oh, Marco…” Voltage repeated to him in a menacing drawl, “...you never know when to stop, do you?”\n“You’re damn right I don’t,” he shot back.\n“You know they won’t go down easy. And it’s going to *hurt*,” Voltage told Marco.\n“And you know I don’t care…!” Marco called out, slightly fearful. At this point, everyone in the BLOB was looking at what was going on.\n\n“So if you want to come out of this alive…all you have to do is give back what’s mine,” Voltage said as she slowly pointed at Marco’s pocket.\n“And to Alani,” Voltage said as she turned towards her, “I knew you were too weak for this. I could smell it on you this whole time.”\n“No. You didn’t know, Bri…” Alani said to her, “...but you already knew…”\n\n\n“...that I’m stronger than I realize.”\n\n\nEveryone stood still. Even the other students in the BLOB stopped talking. The silence that wrapped the air grew louder…\n\n…and louder…\n\n…and louder.\n\nBrianna radioed back in.\n“Get the drive.”\n\n\n"

    "content": "\tNot a moment later, Voltage lunged right at Marco, her taser pointed straight at him. With only milliseconds to react, Marco ducked out of the way. As Voltage’s momentum continued propelling her forward, Marco pushed her into the glass case behind him, shattering it into smithereens. The unmistakable sound of broken glass dispersed throughout the BLOB - everyone was now on high alert. Voltage fell to the ground, incapacitated.\n\n\t“What are you all waiting for?!” Brianna shouted in frustration, noticing that the rest of her recruits were standing still.\n\n“GET. THE DRIVE!”\n\n\tStill running on instinct, Marco dashed to the right and pushed Celsius out of the way, trying to escape. Fahrenheit swiftly tackled Marco onto a nearby table before he could go any further - lunchboxes, plates, and bags hit the ground as Marco and Fahrenheit wiped the table clean with their bodies. \n\nThe students still in the BLOB quickly ran off in a panic, not wanting to get caught in the crossfire. Hexane and Octane tried to rush in, but Alani sprung into action and kicked them back, blocking them right after. Prairie, meanwhile, was unsure of it all. Slowly, she backed a few steps, leaning herself against a nearby shelf as she thought of a plan.\n\n\tMarco shoved Fahrenheit off himself as he got on his feet - but just behind, Celsius got up and swung his arm plate into Marco’s left leg, causing him to fall over. Almost instantly, Fahrenheit dug into Marco’s pocket - and pulled out the drive. Terrified, Marco ran headfirst into Fahrenheit, knocking the wind out of him. Fahrenheit lost grip of the drive - it was now flying through the air. It felt like time slowed down as Prairie saw the drive and ran over to it. She reached her arm out as far as she could, but the drive barely grazed past her fingertips. She hit the ground while the drive bounced a few times, landing on a table on the opposite side of the BLOB - right where Hexane and Octane were. \n\n\tAlani quickly kicked Hexane to the ground as Marco fought off Celsius and Fahrenheit. She then ran to the drive at the same time as Octane. Just a second later, both of them had their hands on the drive - and neither were willing to let go. Octane became agitated - he tried spinning around, but Alani maintained her iron grip. In a fit of rage, he began swinging at her with his free hand. He landed hits on her shoulder and her chest, which she tanked. Lastly, he managed to sock her right in the face, causing both of them to lose grip of the drive - the drive flew in the air and ricocheted off a nearby pillar, landing on a monobloc table placed nearby.\n\n\tEveryone saw the drive resting right on the table - it was now or never.\n\n\tChaos quickly erupted as everyone jumped onto the table, arms outstretched. As they landed on it, its legs gave way, causing it to collapse onto the floor. Soon, it all devolved into a sea of arms and hands as everyone tried to fish for the drive, which had seemingly disappeared. They all stood up in confusion as they tried to figure out where it went. Marco, meanwhile, knew where it was - it was back with him. \n \n\tCarefully, he tried to sneak past and make his way to Glenn. However, Celsius realized something was off - Marco’s hand was hovering suspiciously over his pocket. Marco realized Celsius was onto him and made a run for it. Celsius picked up a nearby water jug and threw it in Marco’s direction - the jug hit Marco in the shoulder, spilling water on a nearby table and making him fall to the ground. Alani ran over and pushed Celsius back before kicking Fahrenheit - Marco got up and fended off Hexane and Octane. The two of them were now fighting their own battles.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack on the roof, Glenn stayed silent as he brainstormed ideas on how to escape. Gone were the days of him avoiding danger at all costs, he thought; now, he was going to have to face it head-on. Soon, he realized that the edge of his laptop was quite sharp and could potentially be used to cut his relatively thin arm restraints. While Overclock and his cronies were busy in the corner, Glenn rubbed his restraints on the edge of his laptop as fast as he could. Glenn’s breathing quickened every time it seemed one of them was about to turn around, but thankfully it never happened. He felt a rush as the restraints gave way, freeing him. What was he going to do now?\n\nSeconds later, Overclock and his cronies turned around, causing Glenn to close the laptop and quickly pretend he was still tied up. Turns out, they were talking to Brianna, who told them all to stay on the roof and guard Glenn. Wildfire stayed on Overclock’s left while Heatwave stayed on his right. As Overclock got back to him, he noticed Glenn was facing them and snickered.\n“Looks like he felt left out,” he joked, to which Wildfire and Heatwave chuckled half-heartedly.\n“Turn around, come on…” Overclock told Glenn as he spun his finger around. Glenn knew they would see his restraints were broken - it was now or never.\n\nSuddenly, Glenn punched Wildfire in the groin. Right after, he kicked Heatwave in the shin and lifted himself off the floor, making sure to pick up the laptop by the handle. Overclock was massively caught off-guard and could only watch as Wildfire and Heatwave fell to the floor, wincing in pain. Glenn tried to dash to the exit, but Overclock side-stepped him and blocked the way. He tried to get a jab in with his gauntlet, but Glenn managed to jump back just in time. Panicked, Glenn decided to run the opposite direction despite every bone in his body telling him not to.\n“Come on, he’s getting away…!” Overclock yelled as he tried to lift Wildfire and Heatwave off the floor. Frustrated, he left them both and chased Glenn down.\n\nGlenn ran as fast as he’d ever had, his breaths growing more painful as he pushed himself to the limit. At the back of the roof, he found a wooden ladder leading up to a higher ledge and climbed it. Overclock, who was not far behind, turned the corner and saw Glenn near the top of the ladder. He ran towards him as Glenn was just about to make it. Nearly out of breath, Glenn threw himself over the top and tipped the ladder over, sending it falling onto Overclock. Out of instinct, he held his gauntlet out, causing the ladder to fall on it and break apart. \n\nOverclock yelled out in frustration over his mistake as Glenn caught his breath. Soon, he stood up and looked around before realizing something daunting - \n\nThe only way out of this was through the slanted roof.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack at the BLOB, the brawl between Marco, Alani, and the Rising Phoenix was still in full force. Prairie was still unsure of whether she should help Marco or Alani, especially since she had no fighting experience. On the left side of the BLOB, Marco was fighting Hexane and Octane atop one of the tables. On the right, Alani was fending off Celsius and Fahrenheit with a serving ladle she grabbed from the nearby Imas stand. From the grandstand, Brianna was still watching the brawl intently, making sure her recruits were giving it their all. \n\nMarco had managed to throw Hexane off the table, with him lying in pain on the concrete floor nearby. Octane, on the other hand, remained on the table. Him and Marco were diverting all their power into pushing the other one off like a sumo wrestling match. Marco could feel the soles of his shoes slipping slightly as Octane pushed harder and harder. In the blink of an eye, Octane reached down to Marco’s pocket to try and grab the drive - but Marco quickly grabbed his arm. The two were now at a standstill. Suddenly, Octane heard Celsius yelp in pain - Alani had poured hot food on him before knocking him out with a serving tray shortly after.\n\nDistracted, Octane briefly lost focus, allowing Marco to push him further back. The water spill from the jug Celsius threw touched Octane’s shoe, and he slipped, falling right off the table. Marco fell face first on the table’s surface as Octane fell off. Prairie had a brief moment of relief as she witnessed it. However, she noticed something amiss. Voltage was slowly moving her taser - she had regained her strength moments prior. Prairie also saw Hexane get up, attempting to ambush Marco from behind. Her heart raced as she saw Voltage point her taser at Marco - she was about to fire it. \n\nPrairie quickly grabbed Voltage’s hand and pointed it away from Marco. Before she could react, Voltage pulled the trigger. A pair of electric prongs shot out, flying through the air before attaching themselves to Hexane - he writhed and seized up from the electric shock before falling to the ground seconds later. Voltage angrily turned to Prairie - she got up as Prairie remained on the floor. She reloaded her taser before pointing it at her - she, in turn, braced for the worst. Suddenly, a pencil case hit Voltage across the head. Marco stood there, panting - he was the one who threw it. Voltage quickly turned her attention to him. Prairie tried to get up, but Voltage swiftly kicked her in the stomach, causing her to stay down.\n\n“Prairie…!” Marco yelled out, “Go find Glenn…I’ll take care of this!”\nClutching her stomach, Prairie got up and ran out of the BLOB and up the stairs.\n\nVoltage walked up to Marco, ready to take him down - this was their rematch.\n\n\n\n\nBack on the roof, Wildfire and Heatwave had recovered and made their way to a very ticked-off Overclock. \n\t“He’s up *there* and the ladder’s broken!” Overclock explained angrily as he pointed to the ledge. Wildfire and Heatwave thought for a while before grabbing nearby objects and stacking them up, trying to get enough height to climb the ledge. Glenn stared at the slanted roof - when traversed, it would lead to the giant atrium in the middle of the SHB, with the fish pond right in the middle of it. His heart raced as he tried to muster the courage to walk on the roof, knowing that at any moment he could slip and get seriously injured. As he heard Overlock and his cronies stacking, he knew he had to act fast.\n\nGlenn fought against his instincts and tried taking deep breaths. His entire body was shaking as he placed his foot right before the slanted roof. Despite all of this, his grip on the laptop tightened. The future of Pisay depended on him.\n\nHe took one deep breath…\n\n…and stepped onto the slanted roof.\n\n\n\nSeconds later, he took another step. He was now fully on the slant.\n\n\tHe slowly bent down and placed his hands down on the roof, trying to gain as much friction as he could. From there, he began taking small side steps to make it to the atrium. \n\n\n\n\tThen, he slipped.\n\n\n\n\tThankfully, he managed to regain friction with his shoes. His heart skipped a beat, his breathing incredibly rapid to match. Finally, Overclock and his cronies managed to get up onto the ledge. Overclock looked over in shock as he saw Glenn on the slanted roof. Brianna, who was watching the situation closely on the cameras, felt taken aback as well. It seemed that everyone was doing everything in their power to stop her.\n\n\tOverclock and his cronies looked at each other, unsure of what to do. Brianna saw this and angrily radioed in.\n\t“Don’t just stand there…GO AFTER HIM!” she screamed.\n\tOverclock jolted, quickly stepping onto the slanted roof and shuffling towards Glenn. Wildfire and Heatwave, on the other hand, were much more hesitant. Overclock looked back and saw the two of them arguing on who should go first. Their argument quickly escalated, with them starting to shove each other out of frustration. Overclock rolled his eyes and focused back on Glenn, who was nearing the edge of the roof. Some seconds later, Wildfire threw a fit and hopped off the ledge, unwilling to risk his life for this. \n\t“Wildfire, get back there and go after Glenn!” Brianna yelled on the radio.\n\t“WILDFIRE…!”\n\tBrianna slammed her fist on her laptop as Wildfire left the roof. She took a quick glance at the timer -\n\n\nLess than 10 minutes left.\n\nMeanwhile, Glenn made it to the edge of the roof. As he looked down below, he saw the atrium and the small ledges protruding from each floor; he knew he would have to jump down on them to escape. He carefully shuffled down the roof, aiming for the corner ledge to increase the area for him to fall on. He looked behind and saw Overclock halfway to his position. At this rate, he would reach Glenn in less than half a minute. \n\t“It’s a long way down, Glenn…” Overclock taunted, trying to demoralize him. He was right - Glenn was in for a 4-storey drop if he missed the ledge.\n\n\tGlenn watched as Overclock inched closer and closer to him. He looked down at the ledge, then at Overclock, and back and forth. Glenn took a deep breath. Then another, then another. Holding his breath…\n\n\t…he jumped.\n\n\n"

    "content": "\tGlenn felt time slow down as he momentarily went airborne. Suddenly, his entire body slammed onto the concrete ledge, causing him great pain. He panted as he looked at his right hand and saw the laptop still intact - he was still alive. Overclock’s hopes were dashed as he realized Glenn had indeed made it. Glenn fought the pain and got up, trying to escape through the windows of the 4th Floor hallway. To his horror, he saw that all the windows had metal grills on them, something he completely forgot about. He looked around and ran to the 4th Floor Audi windows, trying to find any sort of escape there.\n\n\tAs Glenn made his way to the 4th Floor Audi windows, hugging the walls so he wouldn’t fall off, he heard a loud cracking sound. Overclock had jumped down to the same spot he did, denting the ledge with his gauntlet and absorbing the energy of the impact. Glenn and Overclock made eye contact as the latter adjusted his gauntlet. As Overclock sauntered towards him, Glenn hurriedly opened one of the windows and tried prying the bars off, to no effect. He backed up as Overclock drew closer. He gently shut the window Glenn opened before coming to a halt. Glenn stood there, paralyzed with fear. Suddenly, Overclock swung at Glenn with his gauntlet. \n\nThinking fast, Glenn opened a window to try to block the attack as he ducked, covering his head with the laptop. The gauntlet smashed right through the window, raining glass all over Glenn. He got back up and saw the gauntlet hanging through the empty window frame. Realizing the opportunity, he swung the window frame at Overclock as hard as he could, hitting him hard on the head. The sheer force Glenn used nearly sent himself over the edge - however, he held onto a metal grill just in time and pulled himself right back. As Glenn watched Overclock wince in pain, he saw Heatwave jump down from the roof onto the ledge. He got back up and quickly approached Glenn from the other side. \n\nTo make things worse, Glenn could see the sky turn gray as rain began pouring in. \n“Of course it starts raining now…” he thought to himself.\nAfter quickly looking around, Glenn saw a ledge on the 3rd Floor surrounded by two air-conditioning units - he knew this was his only escape route. As Heatwave was mere moments from getting to him, Glenn held his breath again. \n\nHe jumped down to the ledge - but he wasn’t fast enough.\n\nGlenn slammed into the side of the ledge, losing his grip on the laptop, which landed safely onto it. He was now dangling over the edge, his top half holding on for dear life.  \n\n\n\n\nOver at the BLOB, Voltage was gearing up to face Marco. As Marco got off the table, he looked at the stairs, knowing that Voltage could easily tase him from this angle. However, his heart dropped when he saw who was standing there. It was Sir Ernest. The two of them locked eyes - Marco instantly knew what Sir was thinking.\n\n“Marco! Ayoko na!” Sir yelled out as he walked up to him, “Alam ko ikaw ang gumawa nito - ”\n\nMarco glanced at Voltage - she was about to pull the trigger. \n\n“LOOK OUT!”\n\nMarco pushed Sir and jumped back as the prongs flew past, hitting the corkboard behind them. Sir Ernest froze as he saw Voltage’s taser. Seeing this, he knew he was not cut out for it.\n\n“Ah...uh…hihingi lang ako ng tulong...!” Sir Ernest said as he ran off into the distance, never to be seen again.\n\nAnnoyed, Marco tried to get back on his feet, but Voltage was already in front of him. She grabbed Marco and slammed him hard against the corkboard. As Marco was briefly incapacitated, she took the opportunity to take back the drive from his pocket. A couple of the pubmats posted on the corkboard got dislodged, falling gently onto the ground - this gave Marco an idea.\n\nStanding in front of him, Voltage reloaded her taser and prepared to fire it. Suddenly, Marco pulled out Ramone’s cards from his pocket and threw them at her face - one of the cards slashed Voltage’s cheek from how sharp it was. As she stepped back in pain, Marco lunged at her and grabbed the taser in her hand, trying desperately to take it from her. Voltage remained steady, keeping the taser tightly gripped. The two of them strained themselves as they tried to pry the taser away, with the struggle starting to tire them. From the corner of his eye, Marco saw Octane get back up - quickly, he jerked the taser towards him and fired. The prongs hit Octane and shocked him, downing him as well.\n\n Frustrated, Voltage threw Marco against a nearby table. She activated the close-range mode of the taser and tried to jam it into Marco’s chest. As Marco pushed the taser away from him with all his strength, he watched in horror as the electric arcs drew closer and closer. Realizing he was in trouble, he diverted some of his energy somewhere else.\n\n“Alani…help…!” Marco cried out as loud as he could. \n\nAlani knew right away that she had to act fast - she kicked Fahrenheit away and threw a nearby plate as hard as she could. Marco watched as the plate soared through the air, making its way to him. As Voltage looked over, she watched as the plate hit her taser, damaging the firing mechanism. Right then, she felt a surge of electricity flow through her. Marco pushed her away, causing her to fall back. Seconds later, the shock dissipated, and she was left extremely weak. All she could do now was to ward off Marco with the remnants of her taser as she backed into the BLOB, still in possession of the drive.\n\nMarco and Voltage both knew - she was no longer in control.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile at the grandstand, Brianna’s patience continued to wear thin as she watched her recruits get defeated. With Voltage’s current state, she was now on the brink of losing it. Her entire focus remained on the camera feed - until she heard footsteps. She looked over to her right and saw Darren, who had a tennis headband on. Some days he would play on the tennis court just before classes, and today was one of those. He plopped his stuff on a nearby seat, not seeing Brianna. However, he looked up and quickly noticed her. \n“Oh…Brianna! Hey!” he called out cheerfully as he waved at her. He noticed the mask on her face and was slightly confused by it.\n“What’s that thing you’re wearing? And why do you have a radio…?” he asked earnestly as he got closer to her. Brianna put down the laptop and picked up her cane. She brisk walked towards him and held the cane with both of her hands.\n“...Brianna…?”\n\n\n\n\nBack at the atrium, Glenn was still hanging on for dear life. His chest, which bore the brunt of the impact, felt like it was on fire. The rain wasn’t helping either, making the ledge slightly slippery. Still, Glenn carried on - he began swinging his right leg up, trying to gain momentum and get his foot on the ledge. Overclock, just recovering from the head pain caused by the window frame, looked down and saw Glenn dangling. He also saw Heatwave watching him, unsure what to do.\n\n“Argh…go to the…other side. We need to corner him…!” Overclock told Heatwave as he pointed to the opposite corner of the 3rd Floor atrium ledges. Heatwave complied, walking to the spot Overclock pointed him to. Meanwhile, Glenn finally managed to get his footing on the ledge. With all his strength, he pulled himself up and over, losing his breath as he finished. He grabbed the laptop as he momentarily stared up at the sky and caught his breath, shaken that he had avoided death once more.\n\nHe got back up and climbed onto the nearby air-conditioning unit, only to see that Overclock and Heatwave were about to jump down to his floor. Glenn watched in horror as Overclock successfully landed onto a 3rd Floor ledge. He also realized that other Pisay students were watching them curiously from the windows. As he tried to back up, Glenn tripped over a toolbox that was left there, nearly falling over as it spilt its contents. He looked at the mess and realized there was a metal wrench in it. Glenn swiftly picked it up as he saw Overclock head right towards him, walking right on top of the air-conditioning units.\n\nMeanwhile, Prairie made it all the way to the 4th Floor, huffing and panting by the time she made it to the top of the stairs. After getting a few deep breaths in, she walked to the roof entrance - but as she opened the door, she noticed a group of students huddling around the 4th Floor windows.\n“What’s he doing down there…? And who’s that?” she heard them murmur. Prairie immediately ran over to them, pushing them out of the way to have a look. When she looked down, she instantly realized what was going on.\n“Glenn…!” Prairie called out as loud as she could, “…diyan ka lang…papunta na ako!”\nShe dashed in the opposite direction, desperately trying to make it to Glenn in time.\n\nAt the atrium, Overclock took a swing at Glenn with his gauntlet, who managed to parry it with the wrench. He took another swing in the opposite direction, which Glenn also parried, sending it crashing into the concrete wall. Frustrated, Overclock kicked Glenn away. In return, Glenn threw the wrench right at Overclock. Unfortunately for him, Overclock managed to smack it away with his gauntlet in time, sending it hurtling to the atrium floor. Glenn was now defenseless, save for his laptop.\n\nGlenn quickly backed up as Overclock geared up for another punch. Just before Overclock swung at him, he ducked, causing the gauntlet to go right through the window behind him. The students watching from the sidelines ran away as broken glass rained down on the red tiles of the 3rd Floor. Overclock tried to pull the gauntlet out, but it had gotten caught in the metal grills. Glenn saw this and decided this was the time to strike back. He ran up to Overclock and decked him in the face, happy that he managed to get another hit in. However, he felt a hand gripping the side of the laptop - Overclock managed to take hold of it, smiling menacingly as he did so.\n\nGlenn tried to pull it back, but Overclock’s grip was rock solid. He started to grunt as he used his entire body weight to pry it away. Overclock felt his grip weaken, especially since he was gripping the side and not the handle like Glenn was. Soon, his arm gave way, sending Glenn falling backwards with the laptop. The laptop briefly hung over the edge, but he quickly pulled it back towards him. As he got up and looked around, he saw that Overclock was close to freeing his gauntlet and Heatwave was on the other side, ready to jump. Once again, he was cornered.\n\nRight as Heatwave landed on the ledge across him, Glenn jumped down once again. However, he slammed into a wall - losing grip of the laptop.\n\n“NO!” Glenn yelled out as the laptop slipped from his hand.\n\nHe winced as he watched it fall right onto the concrete floor. The tough metal exterior managed to absorb the impact however, bouncing it onto the ledge of the nearby fish pond. The laptop was now precariously balanced right at the edge - just an inch further and it would plummet into the pond’s cold water.\n\nMeanwhile, Prairie had just made it to the 2nd Floor windows, wading through a crowd of confused and worried students in the process.\n“Glenn! Dito, dito…!” she yelled out, waving to him from behind one of the student-painted windows in front of the library. These windows didn’t have grills on them - he could finally escape, but the laptop was still on the 1st Floor. Before he could think about it, Prairie yelled at him again.\n\n“YUKO…!” Prairie shouted as she pointed at the 3rd Floor. Glenn looked up and saw that Overclock was on the other side, about to throw a piece of the atrium ledge that he had broken off with the gauntlet. He threw the cracked piece at Glenn, who managed to duck just in time, smashing the window right behind him. He also began throwing pieces at Prairie, forcing her to hide under the windows. \n\nOverclock smashed right through the painted windows without a care, sprinkling glass all over the floor and causing other students to flee as fast as they could. All of a sudden, the onslaught stopped - Overclock’s gauntlet had jammed, forcing him to recalibrate it. Noticing this, Glenn quickly made a beeline to the nearest painted window - but up ahead, Heatwave had just jumped down to the 2nd Floor. \n\nHe rushed towards Glenn and pushed him back, causing him to fall down. As Glenn tried to get back up, Heatwave started walking to him; this was not good, Glenn thought. As he walked closer, Glenn was prepared to face the pain. But suddenly, an empty window frame swung hard and smacked Heatwave right in the face. Seconds later, he collapsed, knocked unconscious by the impact. Confused, Glenn got up, seeing that Prairie had swung the window open. \n“Thanks…” he told her, still high on adrenaline.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a thud nearby - it was Overclock, who finally jumped down to the 2nd Floor. \n“You need to get out of here…the laptop’s down at the pond! I’ll deal with him…” Glenn told Prairie, who hesitantly ran off to get it. \nOverclock locked eyes with Glenn, who stood there, motionless. He looked at a nearby window grill, primed his gauntlet, and ripped it right out. However, when he looked back over, Glenn was gone. He ran in front of the broken windows and looked around, but Glenn was nowhere to be seen. Right then, as he saw the laptop at the edge, he had an epiphany - all he needed to do to stop Glenn was to knock it into the water.\n\nOverclock quickly held up the grills he ripped off and aimed it at the laptop. His fist shook as he eyeballed the shot. But suddenly, from the corner of his eye, he saw the window frame beside him swing open. He was struck on the side, sending him hurtling to the 1st Floor. As Overclock fell in what felt like slow-motion, he looked at the broken windows and saw Glenn standing right there. \n\nOverclock hit the floor hard, breaking a couple of bones from the impact. After the fall, he lay there, losing the energy to move at all. He groaned as his adrenaline wore off and the pain from the whole encounter started to set in.\n\nHe had finally been bested.\n\n\n"

    "content": "\tMeanwhile at the grandstand, Brianna dusted herself off before going back to her spot. As she walked away, she left Darren face-flat on one of the grandstand seats - she had made quick work of him, leaving him battered and unconscious. She checked her laptop, quickly realizing that the tide still hadn’t shifted her way. The timer now read 7 minutes. Calmly, Brianna closed the laptop and hid it out of view. She radioed in and told Voltage to hang in there. Afterwards, she picked up her cane and hurried down the grandstand steps.\n\n\t“If you want it done, do it yourself…” she thought as she ran across the field.\n\n\tOver at the BLOB, Marco and Alani were finishing off the last of the Rising Phoenix recruits. Alani was in a fist fight with Fahrenheit, which quickly ended after she threw an uppercut out of left field. The only one left was Voltage, who was crawling on the floor, clutching the drive in her hand and holding her broken taser out.\n\t“It’s over! Give it up…!” Marco told her as he headed her way. Suddenly, she used the last of her energy to get up and kick Marco back. Then, she threw the drive towards the entrance of the BLOB. Marco and Alani were briefly confused, but when their eyes followed where it was going, they quickly realized why.\n\n\tA hand reached out and caught the drive mid-air - it was Brianna. \n\n\tMarco and Alani stood still, taking in the gravity of the situation. Alani jumped over the BLOB tables and ran to her, convinced she could talk her out of this.\n\t“Bri…listen to me…” she told Brianna, her voice trembling as she got close.\n\t“Alani, NO!” Marco yelled out. Without hesitation, Brianna took her cane and swiped Alani in the face with it, sending her falling to the ground. Brianna swiftly ran off in the opposite direction, drive in hand. \n\n\tMarco quickly dashed over to Alani and helped her up.\n\t“Check if Prairie and Glenn are okay…I’ll deal with her…!” Marco told Alani as he made sure she was alright. \nAfter checking, he quickly ran off to stop Brianna. Every ounce of energy in his body was going into his legs, trying to run as fast as he possibly could. He could feel a light drizzle coming, which made the floor slightly slippery. He nearly slipped on the metal grates before using it to leap onto the concrete ledge, hotly in pursuit of Brianna. His legs felt like they would give in, but he kept pushing forward. But as he watched her run onto the field, he realized that he couldn’t catch up to her like this - unless he hit her from afar.\n\n\tAs Marco ran, from the corner of his eye, he saw an umbrella and a frisbee left at a nearby gazebo. He grabbed the frisbee and spun once - then twice - and finally let go, using all his strength to throw it. Marco took the umbrella and continued chasing Brianna as he watched the frisbee get ever closer to her. It got closer, then closer, and then he saw it - the frisbee hit her right at the back of her head, causing her to fall hard onto the dirt.\n\t\n\tSoon, Marco caught up to her. They were now right in the middle of the field, only a few meters apart. Brianna quickly stuffed the drive in her pants pocket, which Marco saw clear as day.\n\t“STAY BACK!” Brianna yelled out as she held out her cane. Marco looked over and noticed that she was hunched over and clutching the right side of her mask, grunting in pain. After a few breaths, she took her hand off her mask, throwing a piece of it away - it seemed that when she fell, she had cracked it. When she looked back up, Marco was taken aback; Brianna now had a large gash across her right eye, leaving her in great pain.\n\n\tThe rain started to intensify. It had now turned into a full-on shower. Something on the grandstand quickly caught Marco’s eye - it was Darren, who still lay there, unconscious. Rage welled up inside him as he realized what happened.\n\t“What did you do to him…?!” he angrily asked Brianna, the rain continuing to get worse.\n\t“He got in the way…” she told him, stifling a smile. That was it - Marco couldn’t take it anymore.\n\n\t“Don’t you see what you’ve done?! All the people you’ve hurt?! How many more before you’re finally satisfied…?!” he yelled out, unleashing every bit of anger inside him. Marco then found himself at the brink of tears.\n\t“...please don’t make me do this…” Marco pleaded tearfully, slowly getting himself into a fighting stance. Brianna remained stoic. Seeing his stance, Brianna took off her coat and mask and threw it off to the side. Then, she fiddled with the handle of her cane - this was her last secret.\n\n\tShe unhooked a latch and tossed the cover of the handle, revealing a small, sharp blade hidden underneath it. The cane now resembled a scythe. Marco trembled as he realized what he was getting into, but he knew there was no turning back. He dug his foot into the soil as he held the umbrella out like a sword. The sky thundered as the two remained still, their clothes soaking in the rain. All of Marco’s pain, suffering, and hard work all led to this moment - and he knew only one of them could win.\n\n\tSilence surrounded them both. The thunder faded into the background.\n\n\t…\n\n\t…\n\n\t…\n\t\n\n\tSuddenly, Brianna charged - and so did Marco. Brianna swung her blade towards Marco’s right side after getting close enough, but he barely managed to block it with his umbrella. Without hesitation, she swept the blade downward to clip Marco’s ankle - but he held firm and steady, refusing to let the blade go nearer. Enraged, she lifted her blade in the air and brought it crashing down with full force. Marco quickly turned the umbrella and blocked it sideways with the metal handle. The steel scratched as it resisted the sharp blade, which was now inches from his face. Marco gritted his teeth and trembled as the force Brianna imparted grew stronger. The blade drew ever closer, and was now just a few centimeters from contact.\n\n\tMarco shot a glance towards Brianna before lifting his right leg and kicking her away, knocking her backwards to the ground. As he tried to regain his bearings, Brianna slashed sideways at his ankles as she tried to get back up. He jumped in the nick in time, the blade coming inches from his left ankle. Marco surged forward - but Brianna had another idea. She whipped her cane back around and hit his right ankle. Marco fell to his knees, the pain shooting right up his leg. \n\t\n\tBrianna forced herself back up and brought her blade down on Marco once more. He quickly opened the umbrella - the blade stabbed through the fabric before getting stuck on it. Grunting furiously, she sent the blade leftward, ripping the entire cover clean off and leaving Marco with nothing but the metal rod. Tired and in pain, Marco got back on his feet - just to see Brianna’s blade coming straight for him. He raised the rod up, catching the blade - the force of her swing was so strong that he skidded backwards on the slippery mud, forming a shallow arc on the ground. Soon, he came to a stop.\n\n\tWith all his might, Marco slammed the rod downwards, dragging Brianna’s blade with it and pinning it to the ground. He stomped on the blade to keep it down before switching the rod to his left hand - he then smacked Brianna across the face with it. She recoiled as the impact of the rod traveled through her skull. Turning back to Marco, her expression turned into that of pure rage as she spat out a bloodied tooth. Almost instantly, Brianna freed her blade from the ground, causing Marco to lose his balance. As he stumbled back, she ran towards him and jumped before kicking him right in the face - which sent them both crashing to the ground.\n\n\tMarco coughed as he wiped the mud from Brianna’s shoe off his cheek - the rain roared as the thunder above them continued to grow louder and louder. As he got up, he spotted something in the mud - it was the drive. It had fallen out of Brianna’s pocket when she kicked him. Brianna saw him looking at the ground, which drew her eyes to the drive as well. In a frenzy, she pushed herself off the ground and ran straight to the drive. Marco, who was further away, used all his power and hurled his metal rod at her - it struck her on the shoulder, causing her to lose grip of the blade, which slipped further away from her on the mud. He bolted towards the drive, but Brianna spun back and kicked him hard in the stomach, stopping him in his tracks. \n\n\tBrianna got back on her feet and swiftly delivered a right hook at his face, causing him to grunt in pain. She tried to follow up with a left hook, but Marco managed to block it with his forearms. The force of her punch made him skid backwards on the mud, forcing him to dig his heels in. He ran up and kicked her square in the chest, which sent her sliding back as well. Without hesitation, Marco ran forth and tackled her. She tried to get her footing in the soil, but the mud under her shoes gave way. She raised her fist and slammed it on Marco’s back, knocking the wind out of him. Gasping, Marco roared and used the last of his strength to push Brianna off to the side, clearing the way to the drive.\n\n Marco looked around for it, but the pain was starting to catch up to him - his vision blurred as he desperately tried to find it. After several harrowing seconds, he spotted it poking out of a nearby puddle. Suddenly, he felt Brianna kick him from behind, sending him flying past the drive. Marco dug his hand into the ground to stop his momentum - he looked up and watched as Brianna picked her blade up by the foot and grabbed it with her right hand. She yelled as she ran towards Marco, slashing her blade wildly at him. Each swing missed him by inches, and he was sent further and further away from the drive.\n\nBrianna took another swing, then one more - Marco could feel himself struggling to keep up as he continued to back away. All he could hear now was the sound of his heart beating.Then, his heart skipped a beat as his right foot slipped on the mud, dropping him on his knee. Brianna took a deep breath as she lifted her blade high in the air once more. Out of instinct, Marco shielded his face with his hands as a last resort - then the blade came crashing down.\n\nMarco felt the blade graze past the side of his head. His eyes widened as he slowly turned towards his left shoulder - there he saw the blade, embedded deep inside. \n\nHe screamed in agony as the pain started to register in his brain - the wound started leaking blood, staining his school uniform a bright red. Brianna stood there, panting, before ripping the blade out of Marco’s shoulder. He collapsed onto the ground, clutching his shoulder tightly as he gasped for air.\n\nBrianna watched as Marco desperately crawled through the mud, trying to get away from her. He felt the rain beat down on him as he inched away. She walked right up behind him and pressed her foot against the back of his leg - he froze, paralyzed with fear. \n“You were never going to stop me, Marco…” she said, leaning in close to him.\n“All I can do now is put you out of your misery.”\n\nShe lifted her foot off Marco’s leg, causing him to curl up into a ball. He shook and whimpered as he continued clutching his shoulder tight, trying to stop himself from bleeding out. The storm around them raged on as Brianna stood in front of Marco, gently wiping his blood off her blade. At the grandstand, Darren managed to regain consciousness, although he barely had enough energy to move. He slowly looked up at the field and saw what Brianna was about to do.\n\n“Goodbye, Marco…” she said coldly.\n\n“I won’t miss you.”\n\nWith that, Brianna raised her blade high up and prepared to deal the final blow. Marco slowly closed his eyes as he saw her blade rise, tears forming in his eyes. As she did this, she heard a voice call out nearby.\n“MARCO! COVER YOUR EYES!” Darren yelled out.\nBrianna looked back in confusion, still holding the blade up - but Marco instantly realized what he meant. He quickly covered his eyes with his arm and turned away as Brianna continued to stand there. She felt her skin tingling and her hair standing up on its end - but by the time she realized…\n\n…it was too late.\n\nA bolt of lightning struck her.\n\nIt hit her blade with a blinding flash and traveled straight through her body, releasing a deafening crack that echoed throughout the whole campus.\n\n\n"

    "content": "\tFor a couple seconds, Brianna stood there in shock. Marco looked up and saw her standing there, frozen. Right after, she collapsed to the ground. Marco panted heavily as he processed what just happened. His ears still rang from the crackle of the lightning. He propped himself up with one arm, still using the other to cover his shoulder. Looking around, he saw the drive, still in the puddle he initially found it in. Losing strength by the second, he laid low and limped to the drive, grunting in pain with every step from the stab wound on his shoulder.\n\n\tMarco picked up the drive with his free hand and examined it - it seemed to be the real deal. He put it in his pocket and briefly looked up at the grandstand to Darren, locking eyes with him. Realizing that his mission wasn’t over yet, Marco turned around and started dragging himself to the FLOB. Every second he spent upright, he could feel himself getting dizzier and dizzier - he knew he only had a few minutes of consciousness left.\n\n\tMeanwhile at the atrium, Prairie made it to the fish pond, quickly pulling the laptop away from the edge. She ran past Overclock with the laptop, still groaning from his injuries. She dashed to the FLOB stairs, where she saw Glenn being helped down them by Alani. \n\t“Argh…set it down…in the FLOB…” Glenn told Prairie as the pain all over his body got worse. She immediately ran into the FLOB, which was filled to the brim with other students. She plopped the laptop down on a table in the middle of the FLOB and opened it…\n\n“S.P.E.C.T.R.E. ACTIVATION: 1 MINUTE 30 SECONDS REMAINING”, the screen displayed.\n\n\tAlani quickly helped Glenn onto a chair in front of the laptop. \n\t“No…we can’t stop it without the drive!” Alani cried out, panicking.\nThe students at the FLOB had watched the entire fight go down in the field, and they noticed that someone was getting closer to them. \n\t“Marco…” Prairie muttered as she looked in the distance. She bolted towards him, not caring about getting soaked in the rain. She ran as fast as her legs could take her, her breath getting more sporadic as she got closer to Marco. Eventually, she reached him.\n\n“Nasa’yo ba yung drive?” Prairie asked frantically. Her concern grew as she noticed the blood on his shoulder.\n“Left…pocket…” Marco told Prairie with what little strength he had left. She reached into his left pocket and, sure enough, the drive was there. A feeling of relief briefly washed over her before she was brought back into reality.\n“Go…!” Marco told her. She complied, running back to Glenn and Alani.\n“Tulungan niyo siya…!” Prairie yelled out to the students around her as she pointed at Marco. The students looked at each other before running out to help him.\n\nPrairie hurriedly handed the drive over to Glenn, who plugged it into the laptop with shaky hands. Thankfully, he managed to plug it in on his first try, granting him access to S.P.E.C.T.R.E. \n“Where did I leave off…” Glenn muttered to himself as he coded the stop signal to propagate through the network. He looked over at the timer…\n\n…30 seconds left.\n\n“Ano meron dito…?” Sir Ernest asked as he walked in.\n“Huwag! Huwag mong….” Prairie begged, a desperate look in her eyes. Sir saw what Glenn was doing and took the hint that this was beyond his current understanding. Glenn’s hands trembled as he entered the last few lines of code needed for the stop signal.\n\n….20 seconds.\n\nMarco finally made it to the FLOB thanks to a couple of students - he was quickly sat onto the nearest table. \n“Darren…grandstand…” he muttered as clearly as he could. The students looked over and indeed saw someone at the grandstand seats.\nDazed and confused, he looked over and saw Glenn furiously typing, with Prairie watching intently. Everyone else was also captivated by what was happening. \n\n…13 seconds.\n\n“There…!” Glenn blurted out as he finished the code. He sent the signal through the S.P.E.C.T.R.E. network and waited anxiously for it to take effect.\n\n…7…6…5…\n\nEveryone was on edge. This was it.\n\n4…\n\n\n3…\n\n\n\n2…\n\n\n\n\n\n1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrairie slowly opened her eyes and looked at the screen...\n\n\n\n\n\n“S.P.E.C.T.R.E. PROGRAM TERMINATED.”\n\n\n“YES!” Glenn yelled out as he collapsed onto the chair, gasping for air. Prairie’s knees buckled and she fell onto the floor in relief - then, she started to tear up.\n\n“We did it…” Glenn said, his voice cracking.\n\n“Salamat, Alani…” Prairie called out as she got back up, but as she looked around, she realized she was nowhere to be found.\n\nWhile Glenn was coding the stop signal, she had sneaked out while everyone was distracted and made her way to the often overlooked Gate 0. No one was there to witness her leave. She threw her hair pin into a nearby bush before stopping momentarily - she looked back at Pisay, one last time.\n“I’ll find you…Carmen,” she told herself.\nShe climbed over the gate before walking off into the distance.\n\nAt the FLOB, Prairie got herself together and brought the laptop over to Marco, who was barely conscious. \n“Marco...panalo tayo,” Prairie told him with a smile on her face. Marco saw what was displayed on the screen and managed to smile back.\n\nA few seconds later, Marco passed out - he had lost too much blood. Sir Ernest ran over as Marco slumped over.\n“Marco!” Sir yelled out as Marco finally slipped into an unconscious state.\n\n\n\nThey won. The Rising Phoenix had fallen.\n\n"

    "content": "\n\t*Beep, beep…*\n\t*Beep, beep…*\n\t*Beep, beep…*\n\n\tThat was the sound Marco heard as he slowly awoke from his slumber. Right away, he felt a dull headache - like he had woken up from an incredibly long nap. He groggily opened his eyes, the lifting of his eyelids feeling like carrying a heavy box. He moved his head and looked around the room - this was definitely Philippine Children’s Medical Center, he realized. \n\nAll the lights were turned off, with the only source of light coming from the window blinds, which colored the room a deep orange. Looking to his left, he saw a heart monitor, which continued to beep steadily. Eyeing downward, he saw a giant bandage wrapped around his left shoulder. His left arm, meanwhile, was placed in a blue sling. At the corner of the room, he saw a nurse - she seemed to be taking notes of some kind.\n\n\t“Urgh…” Marco let out, trying to get the nurse’s attention. She quickly turned around and realized that Marco was finally awake. \n\t“O-oh…Marco…!” the nurse greeted him nervously.\n\t“What…happened?” Marco asked, still in a dazed state.\n\t“Apat na araw kang natulog...stable naman ang vitals mo, kaya okay ka lang dapat. Pero, muntik ka nang mamatay…” she told him before quickly realizing she should’ve phrased it better.\n\t“Where’s…Darren…?” Marco asked once more.\n\t“Darren? Ah…siya. Na-discharge siya kanina, pero nandito pa rin siya. Kanina ka pa niya hinihintay...”\n\tMarco smiled - Darren was okay after all.\n\t\n“Ah, uh...n-naghihintay rin ang nanay mo sa labas...tatawagin ko na siya...!”\n\tBefore Marco could ask her anything else about his situation, she turned his hospital room’s TV on and left to fetch his mom. He gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed she must’ve been a new hire of some kind. However, his attention quickly shifted to the TV, which was set to the news channel.\n\n\t“Balik tayo sa kasong tumutok ang buong bansa: ang pag-uusig sa Rising Phoenix. Narito ang hepe ng PNP na may bagong update sa kanilang imbestigasyon,” the reporter stated in the usual news reporter cadence.\n\t“Nasa kustodiya na ang lahat ng kumpirmadong miyembro ng Rising Phoenix,” the chief told the press, “…nilinaw na namin na walang kinalaman sina Marco, Glenn, at Prairie sa anumang maling gawain. Ginawa nila ang tama para sa bansa. Malaki ang pasasalamat namin na naroon sila sa oras ng pangangailangan.”\n\tMarco couldn’t believe what he was watching - they were being recognized as heroes.\n\n\t“Para naman kay Alonso Datumanong, hindi pa rin namin siya nahahanap. Tinitiyak ko sa inyo, ginagawa namin ang lahat para maaresto siya. Kung sakaling makita niyo siya, agad kayong makipag-ugnayan sa mga awtoridad,” the chief asked as the news flashed a picture of Alani. Marco felt conflicted - he knew she was the reason they were able to win, but something inside him felt that she still had to face the consequences of her actions.\n\n\tA few seconds later, Marco heard the door creak open - it was the nurse, who had Marco’s mom with her. \n\t“Iiwan ko muna kayo...” the nurse said as she left the room.\n\tMarco slowly turned his head to the door. There, he saw his mom, sobbing. \n“MARCO…!” she blurted out, rushing over and giving him the tightest hug she could.\n\t“Mama…careful…my shoulder…” Marco told her weakly.\n\n\t“Marco…I’m so, so sorry…” his mom said tearfully as she held his hand, “...seeing you like that, hooked up to all those machines, almost *dying*…it made me realize that…I was too hard on you.”\n\t“I never wanted you to feel bad about yourself…I just…wanted what’s best for you. But I think…I hurt you instead. Son, I almost *lost* you…!” his mom continued, shedding even more tears. Now, Marco began to sob as well.\n“I thought…you’d never understand…like always,” Marco explained.\n\t“I’m sorry…” his mom said in a whisper, pressing her face on Marco’s hand. They sat there in silence, their sobs the only sound that filled the room.\n\n\t“I understand you now…” Marco’s mom told him through tears, “...please. Go chase your dreams. Be a physicist. Reach for the stars. And…don’t let *anyone* stop you.”\n\tMarco took a moment, struggling to wipe his tears away.\n\t“...Papa would’ve been so proud of you…” Marco’s mom remarked.\n\t“Really…?” Marco asked, choking up.\n\t“Yes…yes he would.” \n\tMarco started to bawl uncontrollably. His mom squeezed his hand tighter and gave him the proudest look he’d ever seen.\n\n“No matter what, Marco…you will always be my child. And…I will *always*...be here for you.”\n\nThe two tearfully embraced for what felt like an eternity - and for the first time in a while, Marco’s heart felt full.\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\tEventually, they decided they’d hugged long enough, with Marco’s mom sitting back in her chair. The two spent the next hour conversing - Marco told his mom everything about the Rising Phoenix, from the S.P.E.C.T.R.E. plot to the crazy situations he got himself into. His mom felt terrible about her son getting beaten up multiple times, but Marco reassured her that everything turned out fine regardless. By the end of it, both of them felt satisfied with where they were at - they had taken the first step in mending their relationship.\n\n\t“Oh, I forgot to say…” Marco’s mom told him, “...but I brought your phone. I noticed that you didn’t take it with you on the day you…stopped them. I know how much you love that thing, heh.”\n\t“Thanks, Mama…” Marco said as he unlocked his phone. Immediately, he noticed something peculiar - in the notifications list, he saw an unusual email. It was titled “A message to Brianna - from Alani”. He turned off his phone and put it in his pocket - right then, he knew what he had to do.\n\t“Nurse…can I walk around the hospital…?” Marco asked the nurse, who had returned moments prior.\n\t“Sinabi sa akin ng mga nurse na stable na ang kondisyon mo...” the nurse explained, “...basta, huwag mo lang masyadong igalaw ang braso mo.”\n\tWith that, Marco said goodbye to his mom as he ventured around the hospital. Before he went looking for Brianna, he knew he had to check up on Glenn and Prairie first. After asking around, he found out exactly where they were.\n\n\tMinutes later, he saw them at the hospital cafeteria, right where he was told - they were sitting at a table, talking in the corner. As he approached them, Prairie noticed him and started waving excitedly. Marco then hurriedly took a seat at their table.\n\t“Marco…!” Glenn exclaimed with a sandwich in his hand, “I was wondering where you were…”\n\t“Dinischarge kami ni Glenn kanina...kumain lang kami bago bumisita sa kwarto mo,” Prairie explained.\n“I just want to stay here for a while. It's so crazy out there…” Glenn remarked.\n“...What happened?” Marco asked, confused.\n“The news keeps trying to interview us…they've been camped outside for a while, but the hospital isn’t letting them inside. It's…more than I expected,” Glenn explained.\n\n“Yung balikat mo…okay na ba?” Prairie asked Marco in a concerned tone as she eyed his bandage and arm sling.\n“It's fine, apparently…I just shouldn't move it too much. Don't worry about it.”\nThe trio briefly fell silent as Glenn took another bite out of his sandwich.\n“So…we did it,” Marco remarked. Glenn and Prairie looked at each other, proud at what they'd accomplished.\n“Yeah…Pisay *is* at a standstill right now, getting S.P.E.C.T.R.E. out of their systems and everything. But at least they still *have* systems…all thanks to us,” Glenn replied. Marco reached over and high-fived Glenn and Prairie.\n\n“I hope it's clear to you guys that…I'm very proud of you,” Marco said, “...despite everything - all the pain, all the hassle - we kept going. And now, we’re…heroes.”\n“Proud din ako sa atin,” Prairie said as she nodded her head.\n“You know...being there in the atrium, jumping off those ledges and almost…falling…that was the first brave thing I've done…ever,” Glenn shared.\n“The whole time I've been with this team, I've just been the guy in the chair. But…maybe I can be more than that. Maybe I can be greater. You know what I mean?”\nMarco stared at him in awe.\n“You were on the atrium ledges?!” he asked, shocked at the revelation. Glenn was caught off-guard and belted out a laugh.\n“I'll tell you more later…” he replied.\n\n“Kung maaari akong magsalita…” Prairie chimed in, “...pinatunayan sa akin ng karanasang ito kung gaano ako kagaling sa pagiging detektib. Iniisip ko...baka ito na talaga ang landas ko. Baka kunin ko ang Crim sa kolehiyo.”\nMarco and Glenn looked at each other - they knew she had a point. They wouldn't have succeeded without her detective expertise.\n“You know what Crim students are like, right…?” Glenn asked, to which Prairie let out an exasperated sigh.\n“Alam ko nga, alam ko…” she said to him, “...sana lang ay makagawa ako ng mabuti para sa aking bayan.”\n“You're gonna be the first good Crim student in the country,” Marco quipped, causing the other two to chuckle.  \n“Jokes aside, I'm glad you both seem to have realized something about yourselves. That's…nice,” Marco told Glenn and Prairie.\n\n“I'm not really the humble type, but I just want to say…thank you. For allowing us to be a part of this,” Glenn told Marco earnestly.\n“Ako rin...binago mo ang buhay namin, Marco. Habambuhay akong magpapasalamat para diyan,” Prairie added.\n“...Promise we’ll still keep in contact after this…?” Marco asked.\n“Promise,” Glenn replied, to which Prairie nodded along.\n\n“Anyway, I have to ask…is Brianna still…alive…?” Marco asked the two of them. Prairie sighed.\n“Oo…buhay pa rin siya, sa awa ng Diyos. Nadaanan namin ang kwarto niya kanina…” Prairie explained, “...kung gusto mo siyang kausapin, pwede ka naming dalhin doon.” \nMarco quickly agreed. Together, they left the canteen and made their way to Brianna's hospital room.\n\n"

    "content": "\tAfter a few minutes of traversing the hospital, the three of them made it to Brianna’s room. However, Marco saw two police officers guarding the door.\n\t“Ikaw ba si Marco Madlangbayan?” one of the officers asked, to which Marco slowly nodded.\n\t“I just want to talk to her…that’s all,” Marco explained.\n\t“Sige,” the other officer replied, “...papapasukin ka namin nang mabilis lang.”\n\tThe officer slowly opened the door for Marco - he quickly waved goodbye to Glenn and Prairie before entering.\n\t“Tandaan mo lang...nanonood kami,” the other officer reminded Marco as he pointed to the small glass window on Brianna’s door. With that, Marco was left to his own devices.\n\n\tAs he got closer to Brianna, Marco noticed that she had a lot more wires, tubes, and bandages on her than he did. Her skin had lightning scars all over it, and her hair was a complete mess. He looked over at her left arm and saw that she was handcuffed to the bed - that explained why the officers let him in, he thought. Marco walked over in front of her bed and stood there - he could see that Brianna was awake.\n\n\tShe coughed and wheezed as she slowly opened her eyes, realizing that someone was in front of her. As soon as she saw who it was, her face turned sour.\n\t“Marco. Marco, Marco, Marco…” Brianna said in a grovely voice as she coughed once more, “...you ruined *everything*.”\n\t“Speak for yourself…” Marco replied, “If you had your way, the whole country would be on its knees right now.”\n\t“Maybe…that’s what it deserves,” Brianna told him, snarling. All Marco could feel for her at that point was pity.\n\t“Someone out there would’ve stopped you, Bri. It just so happened to be me. And even if you won…we would still find a way around it. That’s what it means to be Filipino.”\n\n\t“And…this is what you get. Your hatred consumed you…and hurt everyone else,” Marco said to her before briefly pausing.\n“You know, things happen to us that…aren’t fair. Things that…aren’t up for us to choose. But what we can always choose…is to be kind to others,” he concluded. \n\tUpon hearing this, Brianna snickered to herself.\n\t“You…are still *so* naive…” she rebuked, “...you still think the world is…sunshine and rainbows. We were supposed…to do this together. But then…you turned around and…*destroyed* the only chance we had to actually make…real changes.”\n\t“You took it too far, Bri. It’s as simple as that…” Marco told her.\n\t“We don’t make changes by…taking a torch and burning everything down. You just wanted revenge…and that’s why you lost.”\n\t\n\tMarco stood in silence as Brianna had another bout of coughing.\n\t“I would’ve done it all again if I could. I just wish that stupid lightning didn’t strike me so I…would’ve had the joy…of killing you…!” Brianna said to Marco as she smiled, trying to get a rise out of him - but he stood there, unbothered. She was never going to change, Marco realized, and that wasn’t his problem.\n\t“I didn’t come here just to talk to you, you know…” Marco informed her, “...I don’t care that much about where you end up - wherever that may be.”\n\tMarco pulled out his phone and went to his emails - he then opened the one sent by Alani.\n\t“I got this email in my inbox around…a day ago,” Marco explained, “The subject line reads: A message to Brianna - from Alani.”\n\n\tBrianna instantly froze - her confrontational demeanor evaporated in an instant. Marco noticed it - but regardless, he began to read off the contents of the email.\n\n\t“Dear Brianna - If you even care about what’s happened to me, I’m out here in the world. I’m still on the run, but I’m my own person now. The world doesn't get to tell me who I should be - and most importantly, you don’t. I don’t have to follow your endless orders anymore. I’m free.\n\n\tI know you didn’t really love me. You just knew I was easy to manipulate into doing what you wanted. But I see through you now - and I will never let anyone do what you did to me ever again. Now, I wear what I want, look how I want, and do what I want. And I’m doing what I should’ve done all those years ago. I’m going to find Carmen and tell her how I really feel - because now that I’m free from you, my future is brighter than ever before. Now, I get to carve my own path.\n\n\tI hope someday you feel guilty for every horrible thing you’ve done. And even if you don’t, it doesn’t matter - I heard prison over here is nasty.\n\n\tFarewell - Alani.”\n\nThe room fell silent - Alani put it in a way he never could, Marco thought. Soon, he turned off his phone and slowly put it back in his pocket. Brianna, on the other hand, remained completely still.\n“I think my time here is up…I’ll just leave you to think about all this,” Marco told her as he headed for the door.\n\n“I hope it was worth it,” he said right before leaving the room.\n\nA single tear rolled down Brianna’s cheek. She stared aimlessly at the wall - the silence consuming her wholly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\tAfter Marco left, he realized that Glenn and Prairie were nowhere to be seen. He looked around for a few seconds and saw them in an isolated hallway nearby.\n\t“Oh, Marco!” Glenn called out, “We were walking around and we found - “\n\n\t“Darren…” Marco blurted. Right in between Glenn and Prairie, Darren stood - the top of his head had a bandage wrapped around it. Immediately, the two made eye contact - at that moment, it felt like time had stopped.\n\t“Marco…!” Darren called out, eagerly running up to him. He went up and gave Marco a big hug, making sure not to move his sling.\n\t“You’re okay! You’re okay…” Marco muttered as the two continued to embrace each other. Sensing that they needed privacy, Glenn and Prairie scurried away, leaving them on their own.\n\t“I was so worried you would be dead…” Darren explained, his voice starting to crack slightly.\n\n\t“Marco, I…I need to tell you something…” Darren told him nervously, “...I felt like I was about to die, and-and *you* almost died, and it…made me think that…I should stop being so afraid, ‘cause I…I don’t know what I would’ve done if you’d actually - ”\n\tMarco rubbed Darren’s back and soothed him, trying to get him to calm down. Moments later, Darren stopped rambling and took a deep breath. He stopped embracing Marco and stood in front of him, hands behind his back and head aimed at the floor.\n\t“Marco…what I need to say is that I…I…”\n\n\n\t“I love you too, Darren…” Marco told him.\n\n\t\n\tDarren’s head quickly shot up.\n\t“Lying there on the field, I just kept thinking that…I should’ve told you how I felt. And…now that I’ve been given a second chance, I just…I’m done being afraid,” Marco explained calmly to Darren. Darren, on the other hand, started to tear up.\n\t“Come here…” Marco told him, motioning for another hug. The two shared a long and tight embrace, with Darren crying into Marco’s right shoulder. Before long, Marco started crying tears of joy. \n\n\n\nMarco rested his face on Darren’s hair, and together, the pair lovingly embraced as long as they could, rocking back and forth. \n\nIf there was any moment they wished could last forever, it would be this one.\n\t\n"

    "title": "FINAL DRAFT",
    "content": "\t Three and a half months had passed since the Rising Phoenix was defeated. It was now graduation day for Grade 12 students, and Marco was invited to give a speech to them. The gym was packed to the brim with people, with the front containing all the students and the back containing all the parents, with staff scattered around the sides. Another person was giving a speech on the gym stage - and Marco was up next. He made sure to wear his nicest suit and practice his speech beforehand as many times as possible. As he waited backstage, he continued muttering parts of his speech to himself - and soon, he felt some stage fright setting in.\n\n\n\t“Darren, I…I’m really nervous right now…” Marco told Darren, who was accompanying him.\n\t“Hey, hey…don’t worry…! I know you’ll do great out there,” Darren reassured Marco as he placed his hands on Marco’s shoulders. He quickly tidied up Marco’s suit, smoothing out some slight creases and removing stray pieces of dirt. Marco did feel slightly better, but he still had to take a few deep breaths. Right outside, they could hear the emcee introducing Marco to the crowd.\n\t“Good luck…” Darren said to Marco as he gave him a hug, to which he hugged right back. Right after, Darren left the backstage, discreetly making his way back to the gym. As Marco’s name was called out, he walked calmly to the stage. The applause of the crowd echoed loudly throughout the gym - a surreal feeling for Marco. At the front row, he saw the people he cared about most - his mom, Glenn, and Prairie were there, with an empty seat reserved for Darren. Marco soon made his way to the podium and began his speech.\n\n\t“Good morning, Pisay - students, teachers, administrators, families and friends. Thank you all so much for having me. It is truly an honor to stand before you all today.”\n\n\t“On February 15th, the cyberterrorist organization known as the Rising Phoenix started their final plans to destroy Pisay from the inside, bringing the entire government down with it. This was a premeditated action that came from a group that was operational for years. They nearly won - but at the end of the day, justice prevailed, and those involved were swiftly held accountable.”\n\n\t“This understanding of the situation, while true, is missing a lot of context. In reality, I worked with two, well technically three, other people - Glenn and Prairie, who were part of my team. You may know that already, but I want to emphasize that all of us worked as hard as we could to stop the Rising Phoenix. We spent countless hours looking for clues and following trails of evidence, all without a guarantee that it would lead anywhere. Time we could’ve spent studying or hanging out with friends instead went towards investigating the Rising Phoenix.”\n\n\t“The Rising Phoenix put me through utter hell - whether it was getting punched, kicked, electrocuted, and most of all, stabbed. But to me, the emotional toll was just as, if not more damaging. As the investigation went on, I doubted myself more and more. As more of the Rising Phoenix’s reckless antics were pinned on me, I started to lose faith that I was even doing the right thing.”\n\n\t“The real gut punch was when I learned that my best friend at the time was in fact the true mastermind behind it all. I was devastated - one of the people I trusted the most turned out to be working against me the whole time. I was trapped in a small shed beside the gym and told that I had inadvertently helped my greatest enemy, that all my effort was for nothing. At that point, I had all but given up.”\n\n\t“Now, why am I telling you all this…? Well, some of you might be thinking I’m going to say that it's because I chose to keep going no matter what, or something along those lines. And while that is true, I’m sure you all have heard messages about never giving up about a million times already. No - I’m telling you this because throughout it all, I always had someone who was there for me. Someone to pull me out of the darkness, someone to fight for. *That*...is what kept me going.”\n\n\t“It’s not easy for us to comprehend things on a large scale. It’s hard to envision fighting for an entire collective in your mind when you can’t see who it’s affecting. While I was indeed fighting for the future of the entire Pisay system, in my mind, I was simply fighting for my friends and peers. They were the ones who would take the fall of Pisay’s collapse. All the pain, the regrets…and most of all, the confused anger at the senselessness of it all. Thinking about them going through all of that if I stopped trying pushed me further than I ever would’ve gone on my own.”\n\n\t“My message with this is that you should identify the people you’re fighting for. It could be your parents, your friends - just anyone who you deeply care about. And whenever the going gets tough and you feel like giving up, think of them. Let them be your motivation, the reason you make it to the end. It’s much easier that way. Someday, when you all encounter *your* Rising Phoenix, *your* biggest challenge, and maybe you have already…I hope my words help you find the tenacity to take it down. This country needs us to stand up to evil and injustice, to fight for those who can’t protect themselves.Use your strength for good.”\n\n\t“And speaking of the Rising Phoenix, I feel that I need to make it clear why this all happened. They didn’t form for no reason - it happened because they felt that the Pisay system consistently failed them as students. Their breaking points came when they turned to the system for help and got nothing in return. *That* is what caused this. All of the students in this room can attest that the administration isn’t viewed that favorably. It’s an entity we put up with because we have to. And I’m here to say that this *has* to stop.”\n\n\t“I am by no means defending the Rising Phoenix, but the mere fact that it got to this point shows that something is horribly wrong with the status quo. We as students should not feel like we have to raise hell for the administration to even listen to us. We should not feel like we are constantly breaking our backs with workloads that chew into our time, energy, and willpower. We *should not* feel like being on the brink of an emotional breakdown is a normal occurrence! The way things are *right now* is unacceptable.”\n\n\t“Right now, the administration feels both disconnected and distant from the students it serves - and that needs to change. Change, change is what we need. For so long, it feels like the administration has been so afraid to make any meaningful changes that it’s ended up hurting those who are supposed to be this country’s future scientists. Pisay, to me, is brimming with potential. And…the way things are right now, that potential is being wasted, and worse, used for evil. For the sake of our future scientists, we cannot keep upholding a broken system.”\n\n\t“From now on, the administration needs to listen to us, and in turn, we listen to them. Communication is the key. Once one side breaks down and stops communicating, that’s when we stop improving. We as students know what we want from this school, this…experience we have all been lucky to be a part of. Let us use our voice, our suggestions, our concerns for the betterment of the system. I am not asking for total reverence to students’ demands. I just want everyone to feel seen and heard. Only then can we prevent a threat like the Rising Phoenix from even being born again.”\n\n\t“Thankfully, it seems that we are taking steps in the right direction. I have gotten word that Sir Ernest of the Discipline Office has been placed on administrative leave, and Ma’am Lareigh will fill his position as the DO head - and to me, she is the perfect person to put in this role. When I was at one of my lowest points, after the go-kart crash was being blamed on me, she saw that I was feeling down. And she gave me some comfort and kind words when I needed it the most…so thank you, Ma’am. I will never forget what you did for me. With her as DO head, hopefully we can begin a new era where the DO can do what is right rather than what is required.”\n\n\tMarco looked to the front row, filled with gratitude. Darren was now at his seat, and the two of them made eye contact.\n\n\t“While I’m on the subject of thanking people, there are a few more I would like to thank in detail. Thank you to Darren Quiraños - you are my rock, the one who was with me at my lowest points and showed me the power of being kind. Thank you to my mother, Corrina Madlangbayan - while our relationship has been strenuous until recently, you are and will always be my biggest supporter. Thank you to Glenn Duranca - the defeat of the Rising Phoenix wouldn’t have been possible without your computer expertise, and I have no doubts you will go far in life. And thank you to Prairie Amihan - your steadfast work ethic and your detective sense was invaluable to our investigation, and I know taking down the Rising Phoenix is just the first of the good you will bring to this world.”\n\n\tAll four of them felt a sense of pride as Marco thanked them. Seconds later, the audience gave a round of applause.\n\n\t“One last point I want to make before I conclude this speech is that, looking back at it all, the Rising Phoenix was made of people who were all angry at themselves and the world. It’s easy, and a lot of the time justified, to be angry at the world. The world can be very, very unfair - I know that some of the members of the Rising Phoenix were dealt pretty terrible cards in life. But as *iskolars ng bayan*, it is our responsibility to not let it consume us. Otherwise, you can end up hurting a lot of other people. The only thing worse than the pain and suffering in this world is adding more to it. We owe it to the Filipino people to, at the very least, not go down the path of destruction.”\n\n\t“As graduates going to college, it is important that you all maintain hope, however much you have left, and keep the people you love in mind. Hope and love are what will get you through the toughest of challenges. You may not take down a shadow organization like me and my friends, but you can still make the world a better place with your actions and your words, no matter how small the consequences. When you go out there, take everything I said to heart. And please, be kind. The world really needs it.”\n\n\t“Thank you.”\n\n\tSoon after, the audience erupted into applause. Marco watched with pride as the applause turned into a standing ovation. As the clapping continued to ring out, Marco stepped away from the podium and walked backstage, waving to the crowd as he left. Marco couldn’t help himself - he slowly broke out into a smile, happy that he’d nailed his speech and satisfied with what he’d accomplished.\n\n\n\n\tLong after the graduation ceremony had ended, Marco and Darren remained on campus. They were sitting together on a wooden bench in the Kalachuchi Lane, taking in the view of the trees. The sun was about to set, coloring the sky a beautiful shade of pink and orange. To add to it, the lights on the Kalachuchi trees had turned on, adding to the atmosphere. It felt like paradise on Earth.\n\n\t“You know…I wish this day could last forever,” Marco remarked.\n\n\t“Same…” Darren replied.\n\n\t“I hope I’m doing alright. I’ve…never been in a relationship before. Never thought I would be…” Marco told Darren.\n\n\t“That’s fine…it’s my first time too. And…don’t worry. I think you’re doing great,” Darren reassured him.\n\n\tThe two of them sat in silence for a minute, breathing in the fresh air as they took in the scenery.\n\n\t“I…thought I’d always be alone, you know. I’m glad I have you,” Marco said to Darren, “It’s just…great to finally have peace. After everything.“\n\n\t“If there’s anyone that deserves it…it’s you,” Darren told Marco.\n\n\tThey fell silent once more, letting the serenity wash over them.\n\n\tSlowly, Marco wrapped his arm around Darren. Darren rested his head on Marco’s shoulder, with Marco doing the same onto Darren’s hair.\n\nMarco took a deep breath and exhaled.\n\nAs he watched the sun set, he knew - he had finally found his happy ending.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n"
